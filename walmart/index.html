              <p>Thomas Edison. Henry Ford. Harlan Sanders. Walt Disney. Steve Jobs.</p><p>Sam Walton.</p><p>For us...especially Sam Walton.</p><p>What all these names have in common is their status as icons of business&nbsp;– innovators, achievers and real-life American dream success stories.&nbsp;Perhaps more than any of them, Sam Walton represents the best in all&nbsp;of us, the potential that lies within each and every person who strives to&nbsp;do their best...no matter how humble their beginnings...regardless of&nbsp;where they’re from.<br>I’ve often heard that your brand is what someone says about you when&nbsp;you’re not in the room. Despite his being gone from us over 20 years, the&nbsp;strength of Sam Walton’s brand is what people say not just of him but also&nbsp;what he taught us. What people say when you’re not in the room is one&nbsp;thing. What people say when you’re no longer on this earth is an even&nbsp;stronger indication of one’s personal brand.</p><p>Sam Walton meant a great deal to millions of people. The stories I’ve been&nbsp;fortunate to hear from those who knew Sam personally paint a picture&nbsp;of a man who, despite his enormous success, never lost sight of what&nbsp;really mattered – people. Whether associates, customers, suppliers, even&nbsp;competitors, Sam Walton was able to bring out the best in them because&nbsp;he made the people around him feel like he was indeed one them,&nbsp;nothing more and nothing less. Just how true that was, I’ll leave up to you,&nbsp;the student of Sam Walton’s life, his legacy and his brand.</p><p>And so, with this guide, our purpose is not to stifle creativity or to be&nbsp;rigid and controlling. Instead, it is to be protective of the personal brand&nbsp;that Sam built and to preserve how Sam would have wanted to be&nbsp;remembered.</p>

We’ll be happy to take a&nbsp;closer look at granting special permission for use as appropriate.</p><p>Remember, these guidelines are for internal company use only. Sam was&nbsp;a very popular guy. Around here, he continues to be especially popular.&nbsp;Processing requests to use Sam Walton-related images and resources is a&nbsp;lofty task, time consuming and, at peak times, overwhelming. In response&nbsp;to this, these brand guidelines have been created to help manage and<br>streamline the process, making it easier for internal clients like you to&nbsp;access available resources and use them appropriately...in the ways Sam&nbsp;would have wanted them to be used.</p><p>In order to protect Sam’s brand externally, those outside of the company&nbsp;– suppliers, advertisers, media and others – are subject to a similar but&nbsp;stricter set of usage guidelines. Any requests for using Sam’s brand&nbsp;externally should be submitted to the Walmart Heritage Group (<a href="mailto:????@wal-mart.com">????@wal-mart.com</a>) for guidance in obtaining the proper approvals necessary&nbsp;for the requested usage.</p><p><br></p>

              <p>Sam. It’s straightforward, uncomplicated, likeable and personal. Simply&nbsp;put, Sam just felt being on a first-name basis with everyone was the best&nbsp;way to show respect for associates at all levels within the company –&nbsp;hourly, management, stores, distribution centers, warehouse clubs. For&nbsp;him, there wasn’t room for a Mr., Mrs. or Miss on a name badge, even on&nbsp;his own. Why?

          <span style="">
            
              <p>Sam Walton was born in 1918 in Kingfisher, Oklahoma. In 1942, he joined&nbsp;the military and married Helen Robson on Valentine’s Day of the following&nbsp;year. When his military service ended in 1945, Sam and Helen moved to&nbsp;Iowa and then to Newport, Arkansas. During this time, Sam gained his&nbsp;early retail experience, eventually operating his own variety store along&nbsp;the way before Sam and his family would leave Newport for Bentonville,&nbsp;where he and Helen would raise their four children – Rob, John, Jim and&nbsp;Alice – and he would open Walton’s 5&amp;10 on the downtown square.</p><p>Inspired by the early success of his dime store, and driven to bring even&nbsp;greater opportunity and value to his customers, Sam opened the first&nbsp;Walmart in 1962 in Rogers, Arkansas, at the age of 44. While competitors&nbsp;thought his idea that a successful business could be built around offering&nbsp;lower prices and great service would never work, it turned out the&nbsp;company’s success exceeded even Sam’s expectations. Walmart went&nbsp;public in 1970, and the proceeds financed a steady expansion of the&nbsp;business.</p><p>Sam credited the rapid growth of Walmart not just to the low costs that&nbsp;attracted his customers, but also to his associates. He relied on them to&nbsp;give customers the great shopping experience that would keep them coming back. Sam shared his vision for the company with associates in a&nbsp;way that was nearly unheard of in the industry. He made them partners in&nbsp;the success of the company, and he firmly believed that this partnership&nbsp;was what made Walmart great.</p><p>As the stores grew, so did Sam’s aspirations. In addition to bringing new&nbsp;approaches and technologies to retail, he also experimented with new&nbsp;store formats and even made the decision to take Walmart into Mexico.&nbsp;Sam’s fearlessness in offering lower prices and bringing Walmart’s value&nbsp;to customers in the U.S. and beyond set a standard for the company that&nbsp;lives on to this day. His strong commitment to service and to the values that help individuals, businesses and the country succeed earned him the&nbsp;Presidential Medal of Freedom, awarded by President George H. W. Bush&nbsp;in 1992.</p><p>It was during Sam’s acceptance remarks that he articulated what would&nbsp;come to be Walmart’s official company purpose.</p>

To this day, Walmart remains a leader in the retail&nbsp;industry. It’s committed not just to expanding the business to better serve&nbsp;its customers but also to improving the communities it serves through&nbsp;their efforts to constantly improve what they do and how they do it.</p>

Donning his trademark trucker-style cap. Accepting the nation’s highest civilian honor with pride. These pictures tell a story about the life of a man always mindful of making every day a milestone for the people around him. That was Sam’s legacy.</p><p>We are fortunate to have countless pictures of Sam to serve as reminders of his life, his hard work, his amazing accomplishments. And it’s important that we continue honoring him by only using images that show him doing what he did best. In our book, it’s the only way to do it simply because that’s the way Sam would have wanted it.</p>

              <p>Sam thought it was important to have a little fun and encouraged associates to embrace that philosophy, too. So it’s okay to use images of him engaging in these types of activities. However, with such a long-standing company history, events that may have been appropriate in another era may not be in our current day and age. Be sure to use this filter to determine whether or not images in this category are appropriate for use internally in today’s environment.</p>

              <p>It’s no secret Sam was an avid outdoorsman who loved hunting and fishing. Take a look at the pictures kept in his office. How about that&nbsp;truck of his? And remember Ol’ Roy? He truly enjoyed participating in these types of activities, and he did every chance he could. Photos taken of events of this nature may include content some consider offensive (e.g. hunting rifles, dead animals). However, this content is an accurate portrayal of what is involved in participating in these types of activities. Therefore, these types of images are acceptable for our internal use when good judgment is exercised in selecting ones for use.</p>

              <p>Sam had a strong spirit and spent decades using it to build a healthy company. Even in his later years, in a weakened state of health and wheelchair-bound, he continued to be a force to be reckoned with when it came to guiding the company. Because of this, we feel it is important to only show images of Sam in a good light, in good spirits and in good health. Sam should not be shown in poor/declining health or in his wheel chair under any circumstances, even in images from his Medal of Freedom ceremony.</p>

              <p>It’s no secret that Sam loved his bird dogs, especially Ol’ Roy. He was a faithful companion to Sam, and, as a result, there are all sorts of pictures showing them together out on their hunts. Ol’ Roy was such an important part of Sam’s life that he was given his own private label. Because of this, caution must be used when using Ol’ Roy internally (and especially externally) in order to maintain the appropriate brand standards. Should you choose to utilize images of Sam with Ol’ Roy, be sure to first consult with the Walmart Heritage Group (<a href="mailto:????@wal-mart.com">????@wal-mart.com</a>). And since Ol’ Roy is a registered trademark of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., they can help to ensure the most current Ol’ Roy brand standards are referenced in order to help respect and maintain them.</p>

              <p>Interaction with associates and customers was something Sam had day&nbsp;in and day out for decades. Casual encounters. Investigative inquiries. Follow-up findings. Intensive one-on-ones. This is just how he did business. Many of the images showing Sam in these types of interactions are reflective of his impassioned interest in learning more about what was going on with associates in the stores, buyers in the home office and truckers on the road. Unfortunately, business isn’t always pretty. Some discussions are harder to have than others. Some get heated. Any images of Sam engaged in these activities should be avoided if they give off a negative impression. Instead, images depicting Sam’s interactions with associates and customers should be used, especially if/when showing him in a passionately positive manner.</p>

              <p>Undoubtedly, Sam loved his Ford pick-up truck. After all, hauling hunting dogs around in a Rolls Royce just wasn’t practical. In fact, the truck is on display inside the Walmart Museum and an exact replica of the truck is parked outside, ready to make appearances at special events throughout the area. However, it is important to remember images of Sam’s truck must be used with caution. Ford is a registered trademark of the Ford Motor Company and we are not licensed to use it. Therefore, it is critical that you obtain special assistance in getting permission to use any images of Sam’s truck by contacting the Walmart Heritage Group (????@wal-mart. com).</p>

              <p>To best honor the original intent and ideas presented in photos of Sam, we believe they should stand on their own so they can tell their own unique stories. When using multiple images of Sam, photos should be utilized individually, as separate elements. This way nothing is taken away from the original intent of the photo in error, and we avoid sending multiple and/or conflicting messages to viewers. This is achieved by not merging images or treating them with any type of special effect tool that morphs or combines them with one another.</p>

              <p>Advancements in audio and video technology over the decades have made it an easy task for Walmart to archive its history. Grand openings. Company meetings. Charitable events. Award ceremonies. We are fortunate to have access to this information. It’s a valuable tool for helping us tell Sam’s story, and it allows us to continue building and sharing his legacy with others.</p><p>As with the photographic images we use of Sam, it is important to be mindful of how we portray him when using audio and video. Serving those around him was how he built his legacy. We want to ensure this is how we continue to remember Sam, so reminders of his life, work and accomplishments should be shared in ways that honor him and what he did best. As far as serving his memory goes, it’s just the right thing to do.</p><p>Shareholders? Saturday morning meeting? VPI launch? Grand opening?

              <p>Want to use audio clips of Sam so others can literally hear him delivering his words of wisdom? Or show a video of him motivating associates as&nbsp;a way to engage and motivate your own? Much like choosing the right quote to use from Sam, the right clip – audio or video – can make or break a presentation, too. To achieve impact, create interest and ensure effectiveness when using audio and/or video elements, it’s important to keep the following in mind:</p><p>Sam’s audio/video clips should...</p><p>1. Be used only in the context in which they were intended. This helps ensure they convey his thoughts in a manner reflective of what was truly intended.</p><p>2. Be used for internal, business-related situations only and chosen carefully for relevance and relation to the subject being addressed.</p><p>3. Be used in a positive manner – to emphasize, reinforce, support and inspire. They should never be misconstrued or used in ways that are perceived as negative, chastising or demeaning.</p><p>4. Be credited to its source. In addition, it should always be acknowledged where the audio/video clip was captured, along with the date it occurred (e.g. specific meeting, store, event). This helps to give your audience a frame of reference as they listen to/view the clip and a pathway to explore further or locate it for future reference.</p>

              <p>Brand-/Product-Specific Situations...<br>In the retail business, brands and products are important. After all, if you can’t show them, you can’t very well sell them. Sam knew this. So he did everything he could to tell others about the products in his stores from building the merchant mindset for his associates and bringing in the buyers on VPIs to marketing those products to the masses. While sharing audio and video clips related to this subject matter externally could cause a problem due to implied endorsements and such, internal use is permitted.</p><p>Celebrity Limelight...<br>Saturday morning meetings. Shareholders. Product launches. Charitable giving. Grand opening events. There is no shortage of audio/video footage for any of these things. From the get-go, Walmart’s history has been filled with interactions, visits and appearances that have included celebrities from all walks of life – the big screen and the political scene&nbsp;to charitable partners and associate heroes. Since Sam was a celebrity in his own right, he’s often featured in the limelight with these individuals. Using footage of these types of events for internal purposes is acceptable.</p><p>In Good Fun...<br>He danced the hula on Wall Street. He implemented a company cheer with a “squiggly” move unlike any other. There’s no denying that having fun was important to Sam. He liked what he did and wanted his associates to have a good time, too. It’s acceptable to use footage of these types of events for internal purposes. However, it’s also important to use a filter of good judgment when selecting which audio/video clips to use since what may have been appropriate activity during Sam’s lifetime may no longer be deemed acceptable in our current day and age.</p><p>In Good Health...<br>Sam served as a strong and spirited leader within the company for decades. Even as his health began to decline, he continued to be a dedicated servant leader for his associates. Since our ultimate goal is to remember Sam in a way that best honors his memory, it’s important that any audio/video clips we choose to share with our internal audiences show him in his best light – in good health and good spirits. And, as a general rule of thumb, Sam should never be shown in his wheel chair.</p>

              <p>Out with Ol’ Roy...<br>It’s no secret that Sam loved his bird dogs, especially Ol’ Roy. He was a faithful companion to Sam, and, as a result, Ol’ Roy was given his own private label. Because of this, caution must be used when using Ol’ Roy internally (and especially externally) in order to maintain the appropriate brand standards. Should you choose to utilize audio/video clips of Sam with Ol’ Roy, be sure to first consult with the Walmart Heritage Group (<a href="mailto:???@wal-mart.com">???@wal-mart.com</a>). And since Ol’ Roy is a registered trademark of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., they can help to ensure the most current Ol’ Roy brand standards are referenced in order to help respect and maintain them.</p><p>Positive Interactions...<br>Sam was what you would call a people person. He knew that people made the difference. Whether he was engaged in casual conversation with customers and store associates or in a heated discussion about pressing business matters, it was all just par for the retail course as far as Sam was concerned. Audio/video clips showing Sam interacting with associates and customers should only be used if they clearly depict a positive interaction between the parties involved.</p><p>Politically Correct Ways...<br>Regardless of the topic addressed in an audio/video clip, it’s important to remember that times change. The company, as it exists today, is in a much different world than the one in which Sam started to build it in. What once may have been acceptable to say or do may no longer be considered appropriate. Remember to keep this in mind when selecting audio/video clips for usage.</p><p>Trucking Along...<br>It’s a well-known fact that Sam’s beloved Ford pick-up truck transported him and his hunting dogs day in and day out simply because anything else would have been too fancy. But it may not be so well known that any audio/video clips of Sam that reference his truck verbally and/or visually must be used with caution. Ford is a registered trademark of the Ford Motor Company and we are not licensed to use it. Therefore, it is critical that you obtain special assistance in getting permission to use any images of Sam’s truck by contacting the Walmart Heritage Group (<a href="mailto:????@wal-mart.com).</p>">????@wal-mart.com).</p></a>

              <p>Audio and Video Clips: Footage Requiring Special Permission for Use<br>The majority of the archival audio/video clips we have of Sam are easily accessible and available for internal use. However, there are some, particularly those of a more personal nature (e.g. pre-Walmart, personal family events, etc.) we guard more closely.</p><p>Footage of this nature can be requested for internal use; however, it can only be used if special permission from the Walmart Heritage Group (<a href="mailto:????@wal-mart.com">????@wal-mart.com</a>) is granted. Keep in mind special requests do require detailed specifics about the context in which they will be used. Consideration and/or approvals will not be granted if this supporting information is not provided.</p><p>As a rule of thumb, any audio/video footage depicting the following require special permission for use:</p><p>Pre-Walmart:<br>Audio and/or video recordings of events taken prior to Sam’s founding of Walmart</p><p>Walton Family:<br>Audio and/or video recordings featuring members of Sam’s family (e.g. Helen, Rob, John, Jim, Alice, Bud, etc.) as well as those recorded by the family for family and their own private and/or personal use. (More details on using images including other members of the Walton family are available on pages (??-??)&nbsp;of this guide.)</p><p>Sam’s Personal Events and Activities:<br>Audio and/or video recordings taken while participating in activities of a personal nature (e.g. hunting/fishing trips, in flight, etc.)</p>

              <p>Sam plays a huge role in the history and legacy of our company, but he isn’t the only member of the Walton family who gets a share of the spotlight. With other family members playing key roles in the company and in the community today, it is important to remember they are influential company representatives that also deserve our respect. Here are some guidelines for utilizing their words, images and stories appropriately.</p>

              <p>Quotes and Written Works<br>Want to quote a Shareholders’ speech? To share wisdom from a recently published interview? To motivate fellow associates? The right quote can make or break your message as well as the impact, interest and effectiveness of any idea(s) you intend to present.<br>Therefore, quoting members of the Walton family effectively, appropriately and respectively is a matter of keeping these things in mind.</p><p>Their words should:</p><p>1. Be used only in the context in which they were intended. This helps ensure they convey thoughts appropriately, in a manner reflective of what was truly intended.</p><p>2. Be used for internal, business-related situations only and chosen carefully for relevance and relation to the subject being addressed.</p><p>3. Be used in a positive manner – to emphasize, reinforce, support and inspire. They should never be misconstrued or used in ways perceived as negative, chastising or demeaning.</p><p>4. Be credited to the source...always. When quoting family members, be sure to use quotation marks and acknowledge the source for the words of wisdom you want to share with others.</p>

              <p>Using Audio and Video Clips of the Walton Family<br>From grand openings and company meetings to charitable events and award ceremonies, we have been fortunate to capture our company’s history through audio and video technology. Playing a key role in Walmart’s past 50 years, there are several audio and video clips recording the activities of Walton family members at these events, permitting us to tell the stories about the roles they played in Walmart’s history, too.</p><p>As with the photographic images we use of the Walton family, it is also important to be mindful of how we portray the family when using audio and video. We want to be sure to show our respect for members of the family. And we want to ensure that we feature them appropriately.</p><p>Not sure how to find the audio or video clip you’re looking for? You can request assistance with your search through the Walmart Heritage Group (<a href="mailto:????@wal-mart.com).</p>">????@wal-mart.com).</p></a>

              <p>Best Practices for Usage<br>Want to use audio clips of Rob Walton so others can literally hear him deliver company updates? Or show a video of Helen Walton giving a commencement speech as a way to engage and motivate others? The right clip – audio or video – can make or break a presentation. To achieve impact, create interest and ensure effectiveness when using audio and/or video elements, it’s important to keep the following in mind:<br><br>Audio/video clips featuring the Walton family should…<br><br>1. Be used only in the context in which they were intended. This helps ensure they convey the thoughts in a manner reflective of what was truly intended.<br><br>2. Be used for internal, business-related situations only and chosen carefully for relevance and relation to the subject being addressed.<br><br>3. Be used in a positive manner – to emphasize, reinforce, support and inspire. They should never be misconstrued or used in ways that are perceived as negative, chastising or demeaning.<br><br>4. Be credited to its source. In addition, it should always be acknowledged where the audio/video clip was captured, along with the date it occurred (e.g. specific meeting, store, event). This helps to give your audience a frame of reference as they listen to/view the clip and a pathway to explore further or locate it for future reference.</p>

              <p>Helen Walton was born in 1919 in Claremore, Oklahoma. In April of 1942, after graduating from the University of Oklahoma with a degree in finance, she met Sam Walton and married him shortly thereafter on Valentine’s Day 1943. Together, they would raise their four children ­– Rob, John, Jim and Alice – in Bentonville, Arkansas, where she and Sam would open Walton’s 5&amp;10 on the downtown square.<br><br>In addition to being Sam’s partner in life, Helen was also considered by Sam to be one of his best business advisors. Sam credited her for the original idea for the Walmart profit-sharing plan, which gives all associates an opportunity to share in the profits of the company.&nbsp;<br><br>But Helen was also her own force to be reckoned with as a leader on the philanthropic front. Driven by a passion to improve the lives of those less fortunate than she, she often prefaced her comments about an important cause by saying, “We knew we had to do something.” She focused her charitable giving on a variety of causes, including education, the arts, families and children and she was very active with the Presbyterian Church (USA) at local and national levels.&nbsp;<br><br>While serving as president of the Walton Family Foundation, the largest gift ever made to a public university in the US – $300 million – was provided to the University of Arkansas. She was a supporter of the Walton Arts Center. She served on the Governor’s Task Force on Child Care and the Governor’s Commission on Adult Literacy. And she was elected the first woman President of the Presbyterian Church (USA) Foundation in its almost 200-year history. These examples are only a few of the many ways Helen gave back to others as a volunteer to her community, state and nation.<br><br>On behalf of the Walton family, she accepted the national Patriot Award in 1997, presented by the Congressional Medal of Honor Society – the first time in the Society’s history the award has been presented to a family. She was recognized for her philanthropy and service to education in the state and named one of the top 100 Women in Arkansas five years in a row. And, she and Sam received the Order of the Quetzal (highest civilian award) in Guatemala for service in education to the young people of the country and for mission help among Indian tribes.&nbsp;<br><br>After a lifetime devoted to helping others and to improving the quality of life in Northwest Arkansas, Helen passed away in 2007 at the age of 87.</p>
