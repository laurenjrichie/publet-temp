They contend that customers can’t articulate their needs, and that customers have latent needs—or needs they don’t know they have. What if it turns out that this thinking is wrong? Here is the answer: instead of failing 80 percent of the time, companies will succeed in their innovation efforts 86 percent of the time. How do we know this? Because over the past 20 years we have created and refined an innovation process called Outcome-Driven Innovation® (ODI) that invalidates this old thinking. In addition, a ten-year track record study reveals that when the world’s most respected companies silence the voice of the customer and gather the right inputs for the innovation process, they experience an 86 percent success rate. This is a complete turn-around in the innovation industry. Learn how thinking about customer needs from a “jobs-to-be-done” perspective enables companies to create winning growth strategies and breakthrough products and services.</p></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Heading Block--><h1 class="heading" style="">Introduction</h1><!--End Heading Block--><!--Text Block--><span style=""><p><a target="_blank" href="http://strategyn.com/">Strategyn’s</a> innovation methodology and comprehensive innovation programs are being adopted by many respected companies that are seeking to improve their innovation practices—companies such as Johnson &amp; Johnson, Ingersoll Rand, SHRM, Hewlett-Packard, Colgate-Palmolive, Pershing, and dozens of others.

To help get these jobs done, people hire products and services. Thus, from a customer’s perspective, products and services are acquired as a means to help them get jobs done. This concept, which was introduced by Theodore Levitt back in 1975, when he said “people don’t want a quarter-inch drill, they want a quarter-inch hole,” has driven our thinking for years, and other prominent academics are in solid agreement with this basic construct. Harvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen, for example, says, “the job, not the customer, is the fundamental unit of analysis for a marketer who hopes to develop products that customers will buy.” What makes <a target="_blank" href="http://strategyn.com/">Strategyn’s</a> methodology for understanding customer needs unique and revolutionary is that it is focused on the job the customer has hired a product to perform rather than on the product, which is the inherent focus of traditional VOC practices. With a job focus, companies are better able to understand customer needs in existing markets and are also able to capture a full set of needs in markets in which products and services have yet to be created (white space, blue ocean), making <a target="_blank" href="http://strategyn.com/">Strategyn’s</a> methodology a superior tool for sustaining as well as breakthrough innovation.</p></span><!--End Text Block--><div class="photo-grid row"><div class="photo-grid-photo four columns alpha"><img src="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/y4FEKV5ZTUSSjrn2UrtA?signature=b27ff19f30657670f4edca9056ed3841ed4d69374c3034ba8f4b57f9a363d47c&amp;policy=eyJjYWxsIjogWyJyZWFkIiwgImNvbnZlcnQiXSwgImV4cGlyeSI6ICIyNTI0NjU4NDAwIn0=" /></div><div class="photo-grid-photo four columns"><img src="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/m9SjDhhxTcaOAYNUChI2?signature=b27ff19f30657670f4edca9056ed3841ed4d69374c3034ba8f4b57f9a363d47c&amp;policy=eyJjYWxsIjogWyJyZWFkIiwgImNvbnZlcnQiXSwgImV4cGlyeSI6ICIyNTI0NjU4NDAwIn0=" /></div><div class="photo-grid-photo four columns omega"><img src="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/eVr17bjIToOOvj71KofL?signature=b27ff19f30657670f4edca9056ed3841ed4d69374c3034ba8f4b57f9a363d47c&amp;policy=eyJjYWxsIjogWyJyZWFkIiwgImNvbnZlcnQiXSwgImV4cGlyeSI6ICIyNTI0NjU4NDAwIn0=" /></div><p></p></div><!--Text Block--><span style=""><p>ODI critics often fail to understand the ramification that a job focus has on gathering the customer inputs. Whether the goal is to devise a new product concept (innovation) or improve a product design (development), traditional VOC practice starts not with the job but with a product or service (such as a razor or a movie theater) and then works to understand customer needs relative to that solution.1 When applied to innovation, this approach may, on occasion, result in the creation of a slightly better mousetrap (a sharper razor or cleaner theater), but works to block the creation of breakthrough concepts (such as Nair or Netflix). In addition, because of its product focus, traditional VOC practice also tends to result in the collection of needs that relate to what we call consumption chain tasks (acquiring, receiving, setting up, using, maintaining, and disposing of a product) rather than the collection of needs that relate to the functional job the customer is trying to get done, even though the job is the reason the customer is using the product in the first place.</p></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Heading Block--><h1 class="heading" style=""></h1><h2 class="subheading" style=" ">The Framework for Understanding Customer Needs</h2><!--End Heading Block--><!--Text Block--><span style=""><p>Before an attempt is made to capture the customer’s needs for the purpose of innovation, Strategyn’s methodology requires that a company first understand exactly what job the customer is trying to get done. This is accomplished by conducting customer interviews to understand the discrete process steps that comprise the job. The breakdown of the job into these discrete steps is translated graphically into a job map. Job mapping has many benefits, all of which are discussed in “The Customer-Centered Innovation Map” (Harvard Business Review, May 2008). Its primary purpose is to provide a framework around which to capture and organize need statements and to ensure that all the customer’s needs are captured. Without this insight, a researcher will never know where questioning should be focused or whether or not all the customer’s needs have been uncovered. This has been another ongoing problem with traditional VOC methods.</p></span><!--End Text Block--><blockquote

Here too, Strategyn’s approach is unique: it aims to understand and capture the metrics customers use to measure the successful execution of each step in the job they are trying to get done. Those metrics are the customer’s needs: Strategyn defines customer needs as the metrics customers use to measure the successful execution of a job. For reasons we will address later, these needs must be expressed in a statement that has a specific structure and uses a particular syntax if they are to be effective inputs into the innovation process. (See “Giving Customers a Fair Hearing,” Sloan Management Review, Spring 2008 for details.) These metrics are known in the outcome-driven world as the customer’s desired outcomes because they explain what the customer wants to achieve when executing the job. The name “outcome-driven innovation” originated in the recognition of these metrics.</p></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Photo Block (column)--><div class="align-column"><!--This containing div will give us better contol of an accompanying caption once we add them--><img src="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/SySviExoTMuoYCTtJaKl?signature=b27ff19f30657670f4edca9056ed3841ed4d69374c3034ba8f4b57f9a363d47c&policy=eyJjYWxsIjogWyJyZWFkIiwgImNvbnZlcnQiXSwgImV4cGlyeSI6ICIyNTI0NjU4NDAwIn0=" class="" /><p></p></div><!--End Photo Block--><!--Photo Block (left)--><!--Photo Block (right)--><!--Photo Block (left breaking)--><!--Photo Block (full width) NOTE: all blocks with full-width alignment specified need to break the .twelve and .container divs temporarily as shown below--><!--Photo Block (right breaking)--><!--End Photo Block--><!--Text Block--><span style=""><p>As companies decide what innovation process and practices they want to adopt, we, like our competitors, believe that companies should understand the inherent weaknesses of each.

Katz and other traditional VOC practitioners criticize ODI for what they claim to be lengthy surveys and complicated methods: we would argue that any research process has trade-offs, and we are willing to trade off ease of process for completeness of information needed to succeed at devising breakthrough product concepts. Some companies, including Microsoft, have been kind and supportive enough to work with us to overcome any complexities and the concerns of traditional market researchers. The remaining risks in using this innovation methodology, in our opinion, are minor and are far outweighed by the benefits.</p></span><!--End Text Block--></div></div></article>

Focus groups, one-on-one interviews, and ethnography work equally well when the task is eliciting customer needs—but only when the needs that are being sought are job and desired-outcome statements. If a practitioner is not clear on what a customer need is or if the job is not explicitly stated as the unit of analysis, then we agree with Katz that ethnography is the better approach.

We ask the respondent to identify the product or service they use most often to get the job done and to rate satisfaction with just that one product in mind. Since different respondents use different products to get the job done, product-to-product comparisons can be made after the data is collected. This is the only approach we have ever used.</p></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Heading Block--><h1 class="heading" style=""></h1><h2 class="subheading" style=" ">The Structure and Syntax of a Need Statement</h2><!--End Heading Block--><!--Photo Block (column)--><div class="align-edge-right"><!--This containing div will give us better contol of an accompanying caption once we add them--><img src="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/koEID3rsRTKDF7BAtmTw?signature=b27ff19f30657670f4edca9056ed3841ed4d69374c3034ba8f4b57f9a363d47c&policy=eyJjYWxsIjogWyJyZWFkIiwgImNvbnZlcnQiXSwgImV4cGlyeSI6ICIyNTI0NjU4NDAwIn0=" class="" /><p></p></div><!--End Photo Block--><!--Photo Block (left)--><!--Photo Block (right)--><!--Photo Block (left breaking)--><!--Photo Block (full width) NOTE: all blocks with full-width alignment specified need to break the .twelve and .container divs temporarily as shown below--><!--Photo Block (right breaking)--><!--End Photo Block--><!--Text Block--><span style=""><p>Traditional VOC position: Katz claims that Strategyn’s key reason for standardizing the structure of a need statement is to remove ambiguity for both the customer and the product developer, but he says that using a standardized structure for this purpose runs counter to the prevailing wisdom of VOC.</p><p>Strategyn’s view: Ambiguity is a source of concern when capturing customer needs, but it is not our motivation for standardization. Standardization serves a much broader purpose: it ensures the customer’s unmet needs can be accurately prioritized. The goal in prioritizing need statements is to determine which needs are more important and less satisfied than others.</p></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Heading Block--><h1 class="heading" style=""></h1><h2 class="subheading" style=" ">The Sanctity of the Customer’s Words</h2><!--End Heading Block--><!--Photo Block (column)--><div class="align-edge-left"><!--This containing div will give us better contol of an accompanying caption once we add them--><img src="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/vTm0aGOjQKyzWbZjs0jc?signature=b27ff19f30657670f4edca9056ed3841ed4d69374c3034ba8f4b57f9a363d47c&policy=eyJjYWxsIjogWyJyZWFkIiwgImNvbnZlcnQiXSwgImV4cGlyeSI6ICIyNTI0NjU4NDAwIn0=" class="" /><p></p></div><!--End Photo Block--><!--Photo Block (left)--><!--Photo Block (right)--><!--Photo Block (left breaking)--><!--Photo Block (full width) NOTE: all blocks with full-width alignment specified need to break the .twelve and .container divs temporarily as shown below--><!--Photo Block (right breaking)--><!--End Photo Block--><!--Text Block--><span style=""><p>Traditional VOC position: Katz says that altering customers’ words violates a long-standing VOC best practice: “to preserve the customers’ own words as much as possible, so as not to alter their meaning or inadvertently read a different meaning into what the customer has actually said.” He adds that “Strategyn’s approach… runs counter to prevailing wisdom of VOC” by presenting a voice to the customer that is not their own.</p><p>Strategyn’s view: Strategyn focuses on the job the customer is trying to get done, and as a result, interviewers ask customers what makes each step in the job time-consuming, challenging, problematic, and unpredictable—all questions that encourage customers to talk about the metrics they use to measure the successful execution of the job.

Interestingly, gap analysis, a technique that Katz advocates, combines the same two separate constructs—importance and satisfaction—and has also been used to help identify unmet needs. Gap analysis, however, truly does have an inherent flaw: it fails to prioritize unmet customer needs effectively because it only considers the gap between importance and satisfaction and not the actual importance of a need statement.</p></span><!--End Text Block--></div></div></article>
