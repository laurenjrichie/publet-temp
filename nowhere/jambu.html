There was a jambú tree in our condominium, which dropped its fruit on the cobblestone path near the swimming pool.&nbsp;</p><p>Even the marmosets that lived in the trees turned up their noses, spoiled by the cookies and bits of ripe banana that the children fed to them.</p><p>In a tropical climate, many fruits are available year round: papayas, bananas, jackfruit. The plants are hardy, amenable, long-suffering. They give and give and give. Modern commerce makes up for much of the rest; as in most places in the world now, you can go to the supermarket and buy apples shipped in from Chile and kiwis from New Zealand.&nbsp;</p><p>But many other fruits are rare and seasonal, impossible to find except for during a small window of the year. They aren’t cultivated anywhere else, at least not on a scale that would warrant import and export. Most wouldn’t transport, anyway. Many are harvested from wild stands and, being undomesticated, are shy, temperamental, difficult to control. Indoors, they spoil quickly, or lose their vibrancy, turn sullen in a bowl on the counter, refuse to ripen.</p></span><div class="center-linebreak"><img class="linebreak" src="img/compass.jpg" /></div>

Perhaps adults have lost the taste for them, spoiled by expectations of what a fruit should taste like. Or we’ve lost the elemental pleasure in picking a fruit from the tree or the ground and eating it, a satisfaction whole and complete in itself, one that eclipses the actual taste of the fruit.</p><p>Our nanny, Dete, showed my children how to eat jambús. When they ripened and began to fall she took them to the tree, showed them how to find a good one—not too hard, not too soft. To check for rot, to rub it on the hem of their shirts before biting into it.</p></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Pullquote Block (column)--><blockquote class="align-full"><p>She alighted, breezy and pragmatic, on the low wall of the veranda, and took the baby on her lap.</p></blockquote><!--Pullquote Block (left)--><!--Pullquote Block (left-breaking)--><!--Pullquote Block (right breaking)--><!--Pullquote Block (breaking)--><!--Text Block--><span style=""><p>She came to work for us two days after we arrived in Brazil.

Of course, that was a different era, when visas were easier to come by. And they were both doctors, who could afford to support a nanny in the U.S. But I saw how a nanny quickly becomes part of the family. She is not easily replaceable; to keep a good one, I could already see, one would do almost anything.</p><p>In my more sober, realistic moments, I realized that my relationship with Dete was fleeting, lapidary, destined to disappear. There was no way it could be transplanted to the cold Philadelphia winter.</p><p>I knew that, sooner or later, as Dickinson says, the License closes.</p><p>Even though Dete said plainly from the beginning that she’d want to go, for her to do so would have taken enormous effort, subject to the whims of immigration laws, figuring out how to bring her own young children with her, finding a job for her in the States (or enough money to pay her ourselves).</p><p>I thought of our passports in a drawer upstairs, their wings folded—the blue U.S. ones, the viridescent Brazilian ones.</p></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Text Block--><span style=""><p>I thought of the butterfly exhibit at the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia that my sons used to love: the blue morpho and paper kite, swallowtails and firetips in their steamy indoor garden, flying, resting on the fragile tropical plants, pupating behind the steamy glass.</p><div class="center-linebreak"><img class="linebreak" src="img/compass.jpg" /></div><p>As it was, the inherent imbalances between Dete and me—class, education, age, experience—were compensated by the fact that I was the foreigner: my halting Portuguese; her fluency in the language of food and the natural world; my loneliness, adrift in an unfamiliar country; her familiarity with everyone in the condominium—everyone, it seemed, in the city of Salvador.</p><p>Dete was no more subject to my plucking than the jambús, staring down from their high branches; no more subject to my plucking than the unfamiliar constellations my husband and I stared at in the evenings, swaying in the hammock on our veranda.</p><p>In the morning I would be a foreigner, too, again. I would rise in frustration and in awe at the gentle, early light, the jambú tree outside spreading its blossoms like small bright-pink asterisks across the ground.</p><p>What did it mean to be a foreigner? I had chosen this, and in truth there were many aspects of it that I enjoyed. It gave a name to the feeling of exile. It justified the oddness, the slight out-of-synchness I have felt—that surely everyone feels, one time or another—everywhere. It gave a thrilling, manic edge to the most quotidian routines. It made me see things with new eyes: grocery stores and traffic jams, trees and flowers.</p><div class="center-linebreak"><img class="linebreak" src="img/compass.jpg" /></div><p>The jambú tree flowers on both the trunk and the branches, florescent pink puffballs that disperse in the breeze like confetti.</p><p>A German naturalist traveling in Brazil in the 1930s wrote, “[It] was always a pleasure, when I left the monastery garden for the street, to pass through an alley of Jambo-trees, which, with their crimson flowers, set like candles on the branches and glowing in the green foliage, looked as though they had been illuminated.”</p><p>We had only one tree, but I can imagine a row of them, and how they might provide a sort of luminescent passageway from one space to another, from the cloistered abbey to the street.</p><p>Little cultural attention has been given the water apple. Where are the odes to the water apple, the songs and paeans, the biography of its thick petioles, its crooked trunk and open crown?</p><p>Where are the jambú orchards, the fields of dull, light-green foliage, the fruit thin-skinned and shining on the branches?</p><div class="center-linebreak"><img class="linebreak" src="img/compass.jpg" /></div></span><!--End Text Block-->

  <!--Text Block--><span style=""><p>Also known in English as water apple, or watery rose apple, the appeal of the jambú is largely its thirst-relieving character.&nbsp;<br><br>It is a blank, a placeholder. Small aqueous globe onto which you draw your own map: continent, coastline, tortuous passage.<br><br>We were nowhere near the pampas (which are in Argentina and southern Brazil, thousands of miles from Salvador), but does it matter? Dickinson’s butterfly—like Dickinson’s Brazil—is a mythical creature, an exquisite apparition.<br><br>Dickinson is an exact geographer, but she’s no tour guide to South America. Her maps of dark places are ethereal, made of light and feathers, gossamer and tulle.<br><br>For a more concrete cartography, I turned not to the Rough Guide or Lonely Planet, which always seemed useless, out of date, too obvious or too obscure, but to the early explorers.&nbsp;<br><br>Though perhaps there’s not much difference between Cabral or Darwin on the storm-tossed Atlantic and Dickinson in her Amherst attic, embarking on the great scow of her imagination.&nbsp;<br><br>Or Alexander von Humboldt, who, on a voyage to this same continent in 1799, wrote:<br>“A strange, completely unknown feeling is awoken in us when nearing the equator and crossing from one hemisphere to another… The stars we have known since infancy begin to vanish.<br><br>“And new ones appear, blinking on slowly, in the gentle equinoctial dark.”<br><br>In my small Brazil, I gathered the wild fruits that Dete named for me: jambú, sapotí, pitanga. They provided a map of sorts, too—a chart of seasons and the subtle shifting of the light; of trees and bushes; of childhood, that undomesticated realm of hiding places and negotiations.<br><br>The jambú is almost always eaten out of hand—an impulsive find, sweet afterthought, windfall. But if you take a knife to it, press a deliberate blade against its skin on the cutting board, a cross-section of the fruit reveals a luminous cavity spoked with seeds, a hollow star.</p><div class="align-column"><img src="img/arrow.jpg" /></div></span><!--End Text Block-->
