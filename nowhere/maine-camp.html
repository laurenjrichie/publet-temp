Beeze, Cro, and I went down to the landing to get a rotten dock together. We replaced a few boards and then put an outboard on one end of it, and Beeze and I took it up to the upper camp with the boys. An approaching thunderstorm didn’t seem to faze those at the camp, but we saw very vivid lightning as we proceeded along at a quarter knot per hour, if that. Honor and Alix walked the gravity-feed waterline and ran into problems. Cro took over, essentially connecting old galvanized pipes with tightly wound strips of rubber from inner tubes. I had brought some up for swimming, but they served a better purpose along the waterline. We have water! It was impossible working on the line, as the bugs were terrible and there was a lot less plastic (PVC) piping. Sid Fox brought more plastic last year after Honor was here. It rained on and off all day and we swam that afternoon after an amazing rainstorm. Cro and his kids left for Southwest Harbor…turkey for dinner for us.</p></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Photo Block (column)--><div class="align-column"><img src="img/mc_1.jpg" class=" fade" /></div><!--End Photo Block--><!--Photo Block (left)--><!--Photo Block (right)--><!--Photo Block (left breaking)--><!--Photo Block (full width) NOTE: all blocks with full-width alignment specified need to break the .twelve and .container divs temporarily as shown below--><!--Photo Block (right breaking)--><!--End Photo Block--><!--Text Block--><span style=""><p>Monday, July 31</p><p>Beeze and I put the two Sailfish in the water. It was quite hot and I capsized many times. Anna and Andrew Ingersoll seem to be quite content. I worked on the porch. Honor and Charlie went into town and came back to find the docks in place. Honor’s hamburger casserole for dinner, then we played Password.</p><p>Tuesday, August 1, 1978</p><p>We all went to the landing at Four Corners: Charlie, Beeze, and I to get wood and Honor and Tish to find raspberries. After enough wood, I went to join the raspberry-picking crowd. We walked up an unknown road, ending up at the far end of Sugar Berth then bushwhacking along its shore. Lots of scrapes on the ladies’ legs. We found the canoe at the water-pipe inlet and walked down along the stream to the lower camp and the final leg to the upper cabins. Charlie and Alix had discovered that the propane tank was empty. Honor and I went to town in search of gas. No one was at the tanks, so we went to find Gary Hall, the brother of the gas distributor. We never saw Gary but we saw a truck full of propane tanks on 201 and made a U-turn, following it to the distributor for a replacement tank. Sailing for me in the p.m. followed by ham for dinner brought by the Ingersolls and poker. Beeze was the big winner and I was the big loser. A late evening.</p></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Pullquote Block (column)--><blockquote class="align-full"><p>Edward arranged two long bamboo poles, and at the top of the makeshift mast he’d hung a large Union Jack.</p></blockquote><!--Pullquote Block (left)--><!--Pullquote Block (left-breaking)--><!--Pullquote Block (right breaking)--><!--Pullquote Block (breaking)--><!--Photo Block (column)--><div class="align-column"><img src="img/mc_2.jpg" class="" /></div><!--End Photo Block--><!--Photo Block (left)--><!--Photo Block (right)--><!--Photo Block (left breaking)--><!--Photo Block (full width) NOTE: all blocks with full-width alignment specified need to break the .twelve and .container divs temporarily as shown below--><!--Photo Block (right breaking)--><!--End Photo Block--><!--Text Block--><span style=""><p>Wednesday, August 2, 1978</p><p>Honor, Alix, the kids, and I went down to the dam to fish. Not one fish, but plenty of insect bites. After lunch at the camp I sailed up to the mouth of the Dead Waters and saw two loons and their baby very close up, twenty-five feet away. Incredible noises. Later Honor and I were going to fish up in the Dead Waters, but threatening skies prohibited it. A storm never materialized. Charlie’s Swiss cheese fondue for dinner. Very strong.</p></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Photo Block (column)--><div class="align-column"><!--This containing div will give us better contol of an accompanying caption once we add them--><img src="img/mc_3.jpg" class="" /></div><!--End Photo Block--><!--Photo Block (left)--><!--Photo Block (right)--><!--Photo Block (left breaking)--><!--Photo Block (full width) NOTE: all blocks with full-width alignment specified need to break the .twelve and .container divs temporarily as shown below--><!--Photo Block (right breaking)--><!--End Photo Block--><!--Text Block--><span style=""><p>A lazy morning until lunch. Alix went for a swim, though she is a bit put off by the unknowns in the bottom of the lake. Yesterday, the kids, Alix, Tish, and I went up to Picnic Rock up the lake to pick blueberries for a pie. It was very buggy up there, but there was an extraordinary amount of blueberries. So Tish made a blueberry pie today. Yesterday she made brownies, which were immediately devoured by the kids and me.</p><p>Charlie, the kids, and I went across the lake to look for the trail to the top of Burnt Jacket Mountain. We found lots of bugs and pretty mushrooms. In the afternoon, I found that I was running low on smokes, so I was elected to go into town to get groceries and wine. On the way home in the boat I just missed getting soaked by an incredible, fast-moving thunderstorm. I landed just as the lightning and rain came, but I got the food through! The strong winds pushed the swimming dock down the lake. Leftovers for dinner.</p></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Photo Block (column)--><div class="align-breaking-left marginalia"><!--This containing div will give us better contol of an accompanying caption once we add them--><img src="img/maple.jpg" class="" /></div><!--End Photo Block--><!--Photo Block (left)--><!--Photo Block (right)--><!--Photo Block (left breaking)--><!--Photo Block (full width) NOTE: all blocks with full-width alignment specified need to break the .twelve and .container divs temporarily as shown below--><!--Photo Block (right breaking)--><!--End Photo Block--><!--Text Block--><span style=""><p>Thursday, August 3</p><p>Up very early, at 6:30, and all eight of us piled into the boat and went up to the Dead Waters to check out the wildlife. We were up there for a long time and saw nothing, but many mosquitoes saw us and even though we were covered with Cutter it didn’t work for the hungriest of the mosquitoes. We went around a bend and saw a huge bull moose, his backside to us, but he was there. He stayed in our view a long time, it seemed, until annoyed at something he proceeded into the thicket of alder bushes, woods. We continued up the meandering stream at the NW end of the lake, seeing Cedar Waxwings and a Kingfisher. We turned around and headed home for breakfast.</p></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Photo Block (column)--><div class="align-column"><img src="img/mc_4.jpg" class="" /></div><!--End Photo Block--><!--Photo Block (left)--><!--Photo Block (right)--><!--Photo Block (left breaking)--><!--Photo Block (full width) NOTE: all blocks with full-width alignment specified need to break the .twelve and .container divs temporarily as shown below--><!--Photo Block (right breaking)--><!--End Photo Block--><!--Text Block--><span style=""><p>Friday, August 4, 1978</p><p>The rains kept up with an incredible wind. Then the clouds moved on, but the wind continued. Beeze and Charlie went out on one Sailfish and I went out on the other. The sailing was just incredible. Jim Hamilton arrived around five on a seaplane. A class act. He arrived with the normal amount of luggage and fishing equipment beyond belief: two rods and a steamer-trunk-sized tackle box. The first thing he did after getting settled was to go off to the end of the dock and give it a try. He caught four “chub,” but since they are junk fish he squeezed them to crush their air sacs. Later in the afternoon we saw an osprey carry off one of the dead fish. Dinner of chicken and rice and a cake for Honor as we celebrated her birthday with champagne brought in by Jim. Pretty chilly tonight, so all in by fire in living room.</p><p>Saturday, August 5</p><p>Not much of a wind, broken high clouds and sun threatened by a dropping thermometer. Alix and Beeze left around eleven. Honor and Jim took them down as Charlie and I went to retrieve the swimming dock. Strange yells came from across the lake. Charlie yodeled a bit to egg them on, but they stopped as quickly as they started.</p></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Photo Block (column)--><div class="align-column"><img src="img/mc_5.jpg" class="" /></div><!--End Photo Block--><!--Photo Block (left)--><!--Photo Block (right)--><!--Photo Block (left breaking)--><!--Photo Block (full width) NOTE: all blocks with full-width alignment specified need to break the .twelve and .container divs temporarily as shown below--><!--Photo Block (right breaking)--><!--End Photo Block--><!--Text Block--><span style=""><p>Tish has been painting oils on prepared paper with nice quality of color. I found an easel in my new room, having given up my first to Jim. Honor has been keeping herself busy trying to neaten up the place. We were the first group here this year. Mouse and bat shit is the messiest stuff. Rotten boards on the decks seem to be a major problem or will be in time.</p><p>Jim, Honor, and I went off in a motorboat to fish. Nothing, of course, but we did see an extraordinary sight at the other end of the lake which we couldn’t figure out. Honor pulled out a pair of binoculars and saw that it was Meg and Edward Copsey rowing to camp in a dinghy that Edward pulled out of lower camp’s kitchen. Edward arranged two long bamboo poles and at the top of the makeshift mast he’d hung a large Union Jack. It was an amazing sight and reminded me of the German ship on the lake in The African Queen. Their colorful arrival was met by a reception flotilla of Honor, Jim, and I in an outboard and Charlie and Tish with Anna and Andrew in a canoe. Edward immediately took charge in the kitchen and we switched from half-gallon to gallon bottles of wine. It was quite chilly and damp with occasional sprinkles outside as we sat by a fire inside after dinner…</p></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Photo Block (column)--><div class="align-column"><img src="img/mc_6.jpg" class="" /></div><!--End Photo Block--><!--Photo Block (left)--><!--Photo Block (right)--><!--Photo Block (left breaking)--><!--Photo Block (full width) NOTE: all blocks with full-width alignment specified need to break the .twelve and .container divs temporarily as shown below--><!--Photo Block (right breaking)--><!--End Photo Block--><!--Text Block--><br><div class="align-column"><img src="img/arrow.jpg" /></div><span style=""><p class="bio"><span class="bio-name">PERRY BENSON</span> is an architect and artist in Philadelphia.</p></span><!--End Text Block--></div></div></article>
