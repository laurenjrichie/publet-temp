A local friend of his has set him up here, saying the hotel was clean and cheap.</p><p>It is indeed cheap, forty-five dollars a night, but it does not seem safe. The locks on the doors do not work, and the clerk sits behind bulletproof glass. The man’s room is small and smells of paint, and the outlets don’t work, so he goes down to the hotel bar, which is unadorned and empty.<p></p>He orders a gin and tonic from the Kenyan bartender, who is wearing a red vest and white shirt and black bowtie. The visitor drinks his first drink down, feeling sad about so many things, wanting to be home, wanting to be doing something else, and then orders another. He takes this second drink and, not wanting the bartender to feel compelled to talk to him, he walks to the other side of the bar and sits in front of a large flat-screen television. There is a music video on, in which eight African women in traditional clothing are singing and playing instruments. The song is jangly, buoyant, joyous.</p><p>The man goes back to the bartender to ask who the band is, this all-woman band in the music video. The bartender says he has no idea, so the visitor goes back to his seat and finishes watching the music video. When it’s done, he sees the name of the band on the bottom left corner, writes it down, and finishes his drink. He looks up to find the bartender at his side.</p><p>“You need company?” the bartender asks. His smile is genial, his tone expecting the answer to be yes.</p><p>“Excuse me?” the man says.</p><p>“You want a woman to keep you company?” he asks.</p><p>And because the man is naive and often slow to grasp obvious things, it takes him another few seconds to realize that the bartender is offering him a prostitute.</p><div class="center-linebreak"><img class="linebreak" src="img/linebreak.jpg" /></div><!--Photo Block (column)--><div class="align-breaking-left marginalia"><img src="img/woman.jpg" class=" fade" /></div></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Text Block--><span><p>Everywhere in the world, men who are alone or who seem alone get off airplanes or leave their hotels, and they get in taxis, and they ask the drivers of these taxis to take them to bars, or nightclubs, or to hear live music. And these taxi drivers, without heed and almost without exception, take these men to brothels.</p><p>Once, in Bangkok, accompanying a few friends, one much older and Russian and one younger and American, both of whom thought the whole enterprise—the brothels, Thailand, life altogether—absurd, the visitor found himself in a nightclub where young Thai women danced on steel stages and whose attentions could be rented by the hour. A slightly older Thai woman, holding a clipboard, urged the visitor to spend some time with a young woman in the back room, and the Russian said, Do it, do it, and laughed maniacally.<br></p></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Pullquote Block (column)--><blockquote class="align-full"><p>She quickly disrobed, revealing a body that looked much like the man’s own, at age twelve.</p></blockquote><!--Pullquote Block (left)--><!--Pullquote Block (left-breaking)--><!--Pullquote Block (right breaking)--><!--Pullquote Block (breaking)--><!--Text Block--><!--Photo Block (column)--><div class="align-breaking-left marginalia"><!--This containing div will give us better contol of an accompanying caption once we add them--><img src="img/cap.jpg" class=" fade" /></div><!--End Photo Block--><!--Photo Block (left)--><!--Photo Block (right)--><!--Photo Block (left breaking)--><!--Photo Block (full width) NOTE: all blocks with full-width alignment specified need to break the .twelve and .container divs temporarily as shown below--><!--Photo Block (right breaking)--><!--End Photo Block--><span class="offset-content-right"><p>Because he was a young man seeking any new experience, the visitor took his notebook and he went with the young Thai woman, feeling wretched as he followed her away from the lights of the club and through a back passageway. The young woman was tiny, shy of a hundred pounds, and led him through a series of narrow hallways, everything lit indigo, and into a white room. She closed the door. On one half of the room there was a shower, white-tiled and so big a dozen people could wash themselves at once. On the other side of the room there was a kind of bed, high like one found in a medical examination room, with a plastic white mattress.</p><p>The young woman motioned him to sit, and he did. She quickly disrobed, revealing a body that looked much like the man’s own, at age twelve. With a stern downward motion, she suggested the man take his clothes off too, but he disabused her of any obligations to work his flesh. He told her he would still pay her for her time, but he wanted only to sit and rest and talk. She understood immediately; it was not an unusual turn of events, it seemed, for a visitor to want no part of the whole thing, to instead want to buy an hour of respite for them both. She scooted back and rested against the wall.</p><p>He asked her name, and she said it was Song.</p><p>“Song?” he asked.</p></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Photo Block (column)-->

The visitor assumed some clever English-speaking madam, maybe the woman with the clipboard, had devised this name, knowing it would be intriguing, sounding like something between a song and a moan, something between music and despair.</p><p>The visitor nodded, smiled, told her she wrote well in English, and found there was nothing more to say. He drew her a few pictures in his notebook, and then, the two of them frustrated by their inability to say anything to each other, lay side by side for the remainder of their time, the music thumping through the walls, the room otherwise as still as a grave. He briefly fell asleep.</p><p>In the bar of the Kenyan hotel, the man smiles and tells the bartender no, he needs no company tonight. He goes up to his room and tries to get online, where he looks up the all-woman band he saw on the television, hoping to buy the music they made.<br></p><div class="align-column"> <img src="img/arrow.jpg" /></div><br></span><!--End Text Block-->
