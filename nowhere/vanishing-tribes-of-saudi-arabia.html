<p class="dropcap">When most people think of Saudi Arabia, they think of rolling sand dunes and nomadic tribesmen living a life of noble solitude while scratching out an existence in the brutal desert heat. The young nation has a more established history, though, reaching back thousands of years. As I saw while filming a documentary in Asir, a land of some of the oldest tribes and cultures in the country, much of that history is now vanishing.</p>

<p>Asir, roughly translated, means “tough,” and everything from the landscape to the people there exemplifies that. The area is named after a confederation of clans. It is made up of four regions and stands as a nation in its own right, with a heavy influence from nearby Yemen to the east. Located about seven hours by car from the coastal city of Jeddah, traveling to Asir is an adventure on its own. Braving desert sandstorms and then climbing near-vertical inclines, we set out to find the last remnants of ancient culture there.</p>
<div class="align-breaking"><img class="" src="img/mohammadturshi.jpg" />
<p class="caption">Mohammad Turshi<br/><br/></p>
</div>
<p>Four years ago, the impetus for this project came while on assignment with <em>Brownbook</em> magazine. One dusty evening as I was photographing the life of then-rising Saudi art star Ahmad Mater, we ventured into an area from which Mater’s family originally came. Starting in Abha, we traveled down a steep mountain road to a hidden valley crowded with farms and agriculture. Some two hours later, we found an elderly man who allegedly built his own mosque.</p>
<p>The sun was just setting over the mountaintop as we drove past the Rejal Alma fortress sitting on a hill in the middle of a small town. Halogen bulbs hanging in the windows swayed in the wind and flickered as they slowly came to life. Alongside the giant fortress and a small mosque, Mohammad Turshi laid out prayer rugs and kneeled to start his evening prayers. His eyes darted up when I approached and I immediately apologized for disturbing him. He stood up, rocking back on his heels, and briskly walked toward me with a smile on his face. “Welcome, welcome, who are you? What brings you here?” </p>
<blockquote class="align-full"><p>The “Bedou” attitude of Saudi Arabia has largely disappeared from the mainstream culture, though, replaced with a desire for shopping malls and shiny cars.</p></blockquote>
<p>Turshi was a strong man, both in physique and in mind, and was constantly working on projects. He made them using traditional building materials in the area. Another, which he had just started renovating, would be a museum about the region’s culture. When Mater offered money and help for his next project, Turshi’s eyes turned from joy to anger. “NO!” he grunted, grabbing Mater’s forearm. “Bring people, but no money.” </p>

<p>Turshi was a proud man, and, as I would see, so were many of Asir’s old-timers. They were the embodiment of what British explorer Wilfred Thesiger wrote about on his travels across the Arabian Desert at the beginning of the 20th century. The “Bedou” attitude of Saudi Arabia has largely disappeared from the mainstream culture, though, replaced with a desire for shopping malls and shiny cars. Yet here stood Turshi, a man out of time in a world now different and unknown to most Saudis, as well as to the rest of the world. </p>

<h2 class="subheading">The Beginning</h2>
<div class="align-breaking-left marginalia"><img src="img/squiggle_6.jpg" class="" /></div>
<p>I am Swiss, but I’ve been drawn to photography since I was young. One day, haphazardly as a 16-year-old, I came across my father’s Minolta X-700. The story that followed was the usual cliché of wanting to be a <em>National Geographic</em> explorer, but more importantly I wanted to tell stories. Thesiger’s journals, which I later discovered, were the first accounts I ever read of foreign cultures. Obviously the days of early 19th and 20th century exploration are gone, but the study of unknown cultures still exists. Living in Saudi for so long, I discovered just how much of the country, both in history and in reality, was still hidden but in existence. Given how the rest of the world had a very single-minded interpretation of what the Kingdom was, I wanted to reveal some deeper layers. </p>

<p>With the help of Niche Arabia and Princess Reema Al-Saud, I was able to embark on my own ethnographic study. My photography assistant and good friend Sami Alamoudi (of FKAD Design) set out midafternoon on a 700-kilometer drive. With the amount of gear we had, I didn’t want to risk flying. Especially since, on my way into Saudi Arabia, the airline lost all of my luggage—including an aerial drone as well as tripods, stands, hard drives and a laptop. (Note: The bag was found almost three months later, but all the hard drives, the computer and the drone were never recovered.)</p>

<p>Shortly after leaving Jeddah, the terrain changed almost immediately from the rocky desert we were familiar with to a silky line of tan dunes. The air was thick with sand, and for a sunny day, somehow the sky began to darken. We soon passed a bright yellow sign declaring “Danger Sandstorm Hazard Ahead,” and less than five minutes later the sky turned black.</p>



<div class="align-column"><div class="video-wrapper"><div class="video"><iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/91346137" width="" height="" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div></div>

<h1 class="heading"></h1>
<h2 class="subheading">Tanomah</h2>

<p>We waited out the storm and made it to Abha that night. Early the next morning we arrived in Tanomah, a city divided in half by mountains and large sandstone boulders with tiny forests sprouting from dry waterfall ledges. We went there to speak to an elderly shepherd who lives on top of one of the mountains. Located 120 kilometers away from the city center of Abha, Tanomah is home to about 40,000 people. Because of its high altitude, it’s significantly cooler, by about 20 degrees, than Abha.</p>

<p>A thick fog rolled in over the top of a mountain, that would look more at home in Arizona’s Monument Valley, as we arrived at the hotel where Sami and I would stay for the next few days. The mountaintop guesthouse had miraculous views down a jagged, knife-like mountain range rising from the valleys like a row of hands. The next morning, Sami and I stood on the roof enjoying the perpetual wind that blows at this altitude. We watched a cloud drift uphill on the breeze, bend around the mountain and return downhill. Herds of cackling baboons, 50 strong, crossed the mountainside, cutting through parking lots, a children’s playground and, eventually, the other side of the ridge.</p>
<div class="align-breaking"><img class="" src="img/abufahad.jpg" />
<p class="caption">Abu Fahad<br/><br/></p>
</div>
<p>From there we climbed deep into the mountains of Tanomah, crossing abandoned mountaintop villages made of clustered mud houses, power lines and streetlights. We met Abu Fahad, an elderly man in his 80s who still kept a herd of goats that he milked regularly. In his old age he was no longer able to tend the flock by himself. A young Indian expat worked for him herding the 50-odd goats home from the hillside. Abu Fahad shuffled his feet as he chased the goats, chuckling as I tried to follow with my camera. “It makes me sad seeing the young people of Asir,” he later said, putting down a kid and sitting on the stone step in front of his home. “They have lost all connection to the land and the animals…which is where Asir came from.”</p>

<p>In the last 20 years, globalization and the modern world has tightened its grip on even the most remote corners of Asir. Young people have progressively left tribal communities, and it’s painfully obvious in cities like Tanomah, where only the elderly can be seen at markets.</p>


<div class="align-column"><div class="video-wrapper"><div class="video"><iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/91346427" width="" height="" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div></div>

<h1 class="heading"></h1>
<h2 class="subheading">Mukheil</h2>

<p>Our local fixer, Majid, fetched us early Monday morning and led us back through the winding mountain roads around Abha. We passed by a village on the plateau that Abha sits on, and Majid pointed frantically. “You see that hilltop with the mud castle on it?” he asked. “I’m renting that out from the local council of sheikhs.”</p>

<p>The dilapidated hilltop village he was pointing to had seen better days. The community that was once there lived on the banks of a river that flooded the shallow <em>wadi</em> (valley). When Sami and I went back on our last day in Abha to see what Majid was yammering about, we found a ruin of a fortress city where descendants of the original clan now lived. What Majid had been trying to explain was that he was renting the land to turn it into a tourist site.</p>
<blockquote class="align-full"><p>“It is easier to get into North Korea than it is to get into Saudi Arabia.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Tourism in Asir is a bit backwards. Though it’s packed with history, the sightseeing trade is still very young. Guides don’t have a grasp on what they are supposed to do with visitors, and most visitors are not Saudis—rather, Westerners who already live and work in the Kingdom. Getting into Saudi as a tourist is no small feat. The bulk of travelers who visit the home of Islam are religious tourists going to Makkah and Madinah. Japanese photographer Kazuyoshi Nomachi was completing a book on the religions of the world and quipped that “it is easier to get into North Korea than it is to get into Saudi Arabia.” What he meant was that North Korea actually has a tourist-visa process, while in Saudi Arabia the process is highly restricted and only a handful of tourists manage to arrive in the country. The nation is essentially a theocratic state, and the idea of groups of non-Muslim¬ Western tourists isn’t something most people want.</p>
<div class="align-breaking-left marginalia"><img src="img/squiggle_7.jpg" class="" /></div>
<p>Beyond the village, Majid drove us down the mountainside, darting around one cargo truck after another. Baboons stood watch on the cliff faces, skulking through garbage tossed off the highway. When a truck slowed on a steep incline, they bounded onto the cargo and pillaged what they could before leaping off at the top of the hill.</p>

<p>The mountains turned into valleys, which then widened into huge riverbeds with farm plots lining the banks. Old farmers stood hunched over, cutting down forests of cornstalks with steel scythes in 100-degree heat. We were on our way to the traditional market of Mukheil, which is one of the last remaining places where you can buy traditional Asir crafts. We pulled up to a nondescript open square with a crowd of roughly 50 people and half as many shops. A woman gestured to me to look at her wares, reaching into a cardboard box lined with what looked like a blanket and showing me a loaf of bread wrapped in cloth. The only distinguishing features on her face, which was covered with a black <em>niqab</em>, were her eyes, framed by her leathery brown eyelids. She let out a chuckle as I tasted the bread. It was the same consistency as a sweet potato and was one of the richest things I’ve ever tasted.</p>
<div class="align-breaking"><img class="" src="img/ummmohammad.jpg" />
<p class="caption">Umm Mohammad<br/><br/></p>
</div>
<p>In the actual market right behind her, old men drifted between silver triangular tins laid out on the ground. On the far left, a few stalls smelled of fresh jasmine wafting from their wooden shelves. Shop fronts selling large tins and gallon-sized jugs of dark, thick honey sat directly opposite, where vendors were mingling with customers and other sellers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The tins on the ground were not for decoration. They were filled with fresh honeycomb trapped under cylindrical lids, still buzzing with bees. “We use every part of the honey, even the bees,” a vendor said to me while I recorded footage. “Have you ever seen someone use bees for medicine?” he asked. He reached into one of the tins near his feet and grabbed a bee. Then he pressed it against his thumb, trying to make it sting him. “It must be camera shy,” he said with a grin. “If you have bad circulation, we use bee stings to fix it.”</p>

<h1 class="heading"></h1>
<h2 class="subheading">Al-Yanfa</h2>

<p>The next day, two hours from Abha, the narrow streets of Al-Yanfa were lined with antique streetlamps that illuminated the dusk sky. We stepped out of our car and the scene looked like a page ripped out of a history book. I saw a hillside filled with mud-and-stone homes, still occupied by the town’s residents.</p>

<p>The homes were built almost a century ago and were being lived in alongside a few modern homes. We walked along narrow footpaths to the town square. We were here to interview Ali Said Al-Sharai, a retired Saudi Air Force officer who ran a museum in the center of town. Evening prayers echoed through the streets and off the buildings as we wandered around town, waiting for Al-Sharai to finish his prayers. A group of young boys mobbed us as we strolled, curious to know why Sami and I came. Laughing and joking, they poked through our gear and asked us a thousand questions at once: “Why are you here? Where are you from? Do you live in Abha? Are you from America? What’s this? What does it do? Do you like our village?” An elderly man, probably in his 90s, walked by, grinning at the excitement, and shouted, “Welcome to Al-Yanfa!” as he hobbled away on his cane.</p>

<p>Al-Sharai eventually emerged from the mosque and saved us from the prepubescent mob. He was a striking man dressed in a traditional white <em>thobe</em>, with a white <em>shemagh</em> to match his white beard. Speaking English, he ushered us into the museum of the former mayor’s residence, which doubled as a granary in the basement.</p>
<div class="align-breaking"><img class="" src="img/saudi4.jpg" /><p class="caption">Ahmad<br/><br/></p></div>
<p>He gave us a brief history of the region, including an explanation of an attack by Egyptian Air Force bombers more than 50 years ago. Al-Yanfa was a secluded town, he said. “We get our water from 90 wells in the area. You probably saw them outside, and we rely on them all year round, even during the [drought] times.”</p>

<p>His smile waned a little. “This was a huge village. It was like a city, really, but now only a few still live here—not more than 30.”</p>

<p>Historically, Al-Yanfa was of vital importance to the formation of the modern Saudi state. Tribal elders there sent food and soldiers to aid in the expulsion of the Ottoman Empire. Al-Sharai straightened his back and told me that, not to be overshadowed by their own history, “Twenty-two people from this village are now judges, high-ranking officers and government workers in Saudi Arabia.”</p>

<p>Now the cultural fabric there was suffering from the same problem crippling the rest of the region. I asked about the young boys whom we’d met previously: what would happen to them? Would they leave once they were old enough to work? “It makes me sad, but the reality is that people leave because of jobs and education, which are not available here,” he said. “So they move to the big cities.”</p>
