<div class="lead"><img class="fade shadow" src="img/markosian-myanmar-01.jpg" /><br/><br/></div>
<div class="container"><div class="nine columns offset-by-five">



 <p class="dropcap">We slept in a monastery on the first night, fired our guide on day two. Our trek through Myanmar’s Shan State was turning out even more unstructured than we had planned.</p>
<p>Our idea was to avoid the tourist influx that has inundated Myanmar’s most popular sites since its military dictatorship was replaced by a quasi-civilian government three years ago. Most tourist itineraries include a stop at Inle Lake, but a hike there from the mountain village of Kalaw is less common. So we hired a guide and a cook and took a route slightly south of the usual tourist path. Hiking through rice and sugarcane fields during the day, talking with tribal women descended from dragons in the afternoon and sleeping in unheated monasteries with teenage monks in the evening, we were determined to experience nature and a more authentic Myanmar.</p>
<div class="align-breaking-left marginalia"><img class="" src="img/compassrose.jpg" /></div>
<p>The first night, when the guide told us to stay warm by sleeping next to him, was a bit too authentic. When we refused, he informed us that he “hated” us. The next morning, we decided to continue without him, asking the cook to take us the rest of the way. We left before either had time to answer. We were halfway down the hill when Diana questioned our decision: “Do you think the cook will follow?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” I said.</p>
<p>But I wasn’t as sure as I sounded.</p>
<div class="align-column"><img class="fade shadow" src="img/markosian-myanmar-02.jpg" /></div>
<p>Our trip began the day before in the back of an open truck. It was the last vehicle, aside from an occasional scooter, that we would see until the end of the trip. Our guide, Ghochin, told us all he could about Kalaw, a hillside retreat established by the British that remains a popular getaway for the country’s elite. As we walked, Ghochin shaded himself with a bright-red umbrella decorated with images from the popular K-pop song “Gangnam Style.”</p>
<p>The initial route was sparsely populated. Only a handful of farmers worked the rice paddies we passed, and it wasn’t until we stopped for lunch that we had a chance to talk to anyone. Over green tea, Than Gyi told us about her village, interrupting herself frequently to stare at us and laugh. She was 73, a mother of 10 and a grandmother of an “uncountable number.” When she was young, the homes were made of bamboo and there were no cars or motorbikes. Vehicles are still unusual, but homes now are made of brick and wood and have metal roofs instead of thatch. The home we ate lunch in was a two-story wood structure with a simple wooden ladder leading to the second floor. Than Gyi and several other women watched us eat chapatti and curry that the cook, Tharnge, made for us in the home’s kitchen, a bamboo lean-to with a fire pit. We never met the owner of the house, but we did meet several of his grandchildren. Than Gyi was one of his neighbors.  “Sometimes, as a kid, I heard about America, but I didn’t see American people,” Than Gyi said.</p>
<blockquote class="align-full"><p>On one path we stumbled upon a group of brothers herding buffalo with slingshots.</p></blockquote>
<p>She saw her first tourist 10 years ago, three years before the village got a primary school. We left her sitting in the sun shelling peanuts and drinking tea. A series of paths flanked by flowers and fields followed. On one such dusty path we stumbled upon a group of brothers herding buffalo with slingshots. The oldest, Mt Ping, which translates to “clever boy,” was 14 and hadn’t been to school since the fourth grade. As we moved past him he raised his arm and waved, hesitantly at first and then more confidently the farther away we traveled.</p>
<p>We traversed narrow bamboo-plank bridges over trickles of water and wound our way up a steep hill. We kept going, up hills, down into valleys and past tiny villages, noting the change in agriculture as we went: rice, wheat, peanuts, corn, chili peppers. Bawnangone village was bright red with peppers. They were everywhere, drying on mats, roofs and in the fields. They were piled in heaps inside homes, stored in overflowing baskets and stacked in pyramids as high as children. The chili harvest was coming to an end. It had not been a good one, according to one villager. Her family would make between $100 and $1,000 on the crop—enough to live on, but not enough to get rich on.</p>
<div class="align-column"><img class="fade shadow" src="img/markosian-myanmar-03.jpg" /></div>
<p>After the debacle with our guide that night, we took off early in the morning, descending the earthen steps that led down from the Htuntaung Monastery. The monastery itself had consisted of a single room with a high ceiling and numerous decorative pillars. The wall directly opposite the entrance was covered in colorful glass-and-bead mosaics. In front of the mosaics a dozen life-size Buddha figurines rested on a slightly raised stage—on which the young monks watched a muted soccer game on an old television while the abbot chanted. Looking back now, I saw only the moon in the sky and a lonely structure atop the hill.</p>
<p>Tharnge eventually caught up and led us along a narrow dirt path hedged by rhododendrons and bamboo fences, early-morning light reflecting off a tapestry of spider webs. In the distance we could hear the faint ring of a cattle bell and the off-key voice of a farmer singing. We walked through wheat fields taller than our heads and on raised paths between rice paddies. Yellow daisies, sunflowers and butterflies glowed under the sun.</p>
<p>In an open field, a line of women hoed the earth in unison while two little girls harvested and bundled ginger with scythes, their heads covered in red turbans. The women belonged to the Pa-O tribe and wore red head coverings as a reminder of the dragon from which they descended. The forested hills around the lake are shared by various tribes, including the Padaung, whose habit of fitting young girls with neck rings has made them famous. The route we took traversed mostly land belonging to the Pa-O, a tribe that has an interesting tradition when it comes to marriage. Male suitors bring a box of betel leaves and nuts to the home of a potential bride, who then chooses her partner based on the box he brings. Later, if they choose to separate, the couple must break a betel nut to break the union.</p>
<div class="align-column"><img class="fade shadow" src="img/markosian-myanmar-05.jpg" /></div>
<p>We walked into a stretch of desert-like wasteland next and caught our first glimpse of Inle Lake, a sliver of blue peeking from between two distant mountains. Sparse groundcover gradually gave way to a forested canopy, and we climbed through a breach in the mountains. We moved slowly down slippery stones on the other side, careful not to look at the 500-foot drop to our right. At the bottom, we found ourselves in a shaded bamboo forest and met the head of our host family in a sunflower field.</p>
<p>Wandering around the village of 30 or so homes, we found corncobs piled everywhere: in baskets, in homes, in pyramid piles, just as chili peppers had been stacked in the other villages. At dinnertime we gathered around an inside campfire fueled by corncobs and ate popcorn. Most families reside on the second floor of the village’s wooden homes—sleeping, eating and socializing on mats in the main room. In the evening, families build a fire in simple metal apparatuses, and a cat can usually be found curled nearby. In one such home I found not only a cat, but also an English-speaking soldier named Zaw Tan. He was 22 and had been in the military since he was 18.</p>
<p>“Does your father farm wheat?” I asked.</p>
<p>He shook his head no.</p>
<p>“Corn?” Diana tried.</p>
<p>“Sunflowers? Chilis? Peppers?”</p>
<p>The answer was always no. It felt like a game of charades.</p>
<p>“Your father is a farmer; what does he farm?” I tried again.</p>
<p>“I am familiar with the question,” Zaw Tan said.</p>
<div class="align-column"><img class="fade shadow" src="img/markosian-myanmar-06.jpg" /></div>
<p>But the answer did not come until we asked it half a dozen more times. His father grew sunflowers. Figuring out how his father ended up living in another village with a woman other than his mother proved even more complicated—and intriguing—but it was 9 p.m. and bedtime. We snuggled up inside a raised bamboo home that creaked when we turned and bowed in the wind.</p>
<div class="align-breaking-left marginalia"><img class="" src="img/squiggle_22.jpg" /></div>
<p>The next morning, roosters started crowing at 4:30 a.m. Diana’s iPhone blasted “Good Girl” 15 minutes later. We woke and started walking toward the lake. Before sunrise, we were in a wooden motorboat manned by an old fisherman. The boat moved slowly, mindful of floating villages we passed. Residents squatted on their porches to wash dishes in the water while boys floated past on boats and women peeked out of windows. In the distance, fishermen balanced on the front of their wooden crafts, one l eg wrapped around an oar for propulsion and steering, the other standing straight, thus freeing their hands to pull fish from their nets.</p>
<div class="align-column"><img class="fade shadow" src="img/markosian-myanmar-08.jpg" /></div>
<p>The narrow channel soon opened into a large blue expanse that merged with the blue of the sky. Mist hung over everything, clearing occasionally to reveal a lone fisherman. As the sun rose and we neared the lake village of Nyaung Shwe, more boats appeared. In the distance I spotted banners on buildings and a pair of one-legged fishermen with large cone-shaped nets. As we drew closer, the fishermen posed for pictures then paddled over with outstretched hands, uttering a single English word: “Money.”</p>
<p>We were back in tourist territory. On dry land there were dozens of trekking outlets, each offering bike rides, hikes and laundry service. Nu Nu Yin, 30, left her accounting job in August to open Fantastic Inle Travel & Tours with her lover. She was 11 when she saw her first tourist.</p>
<div class="align-column"><img class="fade shadow" src="img/markosian-myanmar-09.jpg" /></div>
<p>“They ask me where is hotel,” she said. “I am afraid tourist so I am running.”</p>
<p>Now she is grateful for the jobs the tourist boom has brought to her once-sleepy town, but admitted it has taken away other jobs.</p>
<p>“Last year, fishermen were real fishermen; now they are just for show, for tourists in the lake.”</p>
<p>We considered ourselves lucky to have caught several of the real ones and headed back to Yangon on an overnight bus.</p>
