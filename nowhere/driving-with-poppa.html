Neutrino had taken the tape off the side of the van. Bits of dust and sand had clung to the edges of the adhesive left behind, so you could still read “Key West to Cuba,” faintly, as if the trip had already been accomplished.</p><p>So that I would be comfortable, Neutrino vacuumed his car. Because he couldn’t get all the dog hair off the passenger seat, he covered it with a coat. Like a Frenchwoman from the historical past, Neutrino often applies perfume instead of bathing. He uses the cheapest fragrances, typically ones he buys at a drugstore. We would be crossing the Mojave Desert. Neutrino thought that he could cool the car for us by filling the interior with ice. He bought four plastic laundry baskets and put them in the back, beside his bed. Before he picked me up he filled the baskets with bags of ice.</p></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Photo Block (column)--><div class="align-breaking-left marginalia"><!--This containing div will give us better contol of an accompanying caption once we add them--><img src="img/Bhagavad-Gita.jpg" class="" /></div><!--End Photo Block--><!--Photo Block (left)--><!--Photo Block (right)--><!--Photo Block (left breaking)--><!--Photo Block (full width) NOTE: all blocks with full-width alignment specified need to break the .twelve and .container divs temporarily as shown below--><!--Photo Block (right breaking)--><!--End Photo Block--><!--Pullquote Block (column)--><blockquote class="align-full"><p>Like a Frenchwoman from the historical past, Neutrino often applies perfume instead of bathing.</p></blockquote><!--Pullquote Block (left)--><!--Pullquote Block (left-breaking)--><!--Pullquote Block (right breaking)--><!--Pullquote Block (breaking)--><!--Text Block--><span style=""><p>We left Santa Monica after breakfast. By the time we reached Palm Springs, the day was hot. The sky was a pale blue. Neutrino said that what he had loved about the Bedouin’s life he had lived in the desert was that you wake up and start to move. On the dashboard was a paperback copy of the Bhagavad-Gita. The dog sat between us, on a blanket. Now and then, Neutrino would pour water on the dog. The water would splash on me, but I don’t think he knew it, because he was watching the road. Then he would pat the dog and more water would fly off her. Then the dog would shake. Neutrino fell in behind the slowest-moving truck on the road. He figured that any vehicle coming toward us that crossed into our lane would hit the truck. Cars passed us going so fast that it was as if they were fleeing something. Every few minutes, Neutrino would stick one hand through the curtain between the seats. “Yeah, that’s working,” he’d say. “I can really feel it cooler now. You feel it?” The water leaked onto the floor and made the red dye on the side of my canvas in-flight bag run over everything inside the bag and stain it red, but I didn’t know that until later. About once an hour we would stop and empty the water from the plastic bags, and every two hours we would buy more ice.&nbsp;</p><div class="center-linebreak"><img class="linebreak" src="img/linebreak_2.jpg" /></div><p>In the desert there were so many high-tension wires that they divided the sky like lines on sheet-music paper. We crossed bridges over dry rivers. The riverbeds and the land around them were the color of linen and looked more like beaches than riverbeds. A sign said one of them was the Gila River.</p></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Photo Block (column)--><div class="align-column"><img src="img/Poppa_1.jpg" class="shadow" /></div><!--End Photo Block--><!--Photo Block (left)--><!--Photo Block (right)--><!--Photo Block (left breaking)--><!--Photo Block (full width) NOTE: all blocks with full-width alignment specified need to break the .twelve and .container divs temporarily as shown below--><!--Photo Block (right breaking)--><!--End Photo Block--><!--Text Block--><span style=""><p>Near Phoenix, we left the highway and drove through fields and past warehouses and stores until we came to a dusty lot and a building that was low and long, with a roof hanging over the front of it, shading the door. A handsome, dark-haired Mexican woman was sweeping a porch in front of the door, and when we turned into the parking lot, she leaned her broom against the doorframe and stepped inside. A man with black hair and a face the color of tobacco met us. Neutrino said, “Remember me?” The man smiled and said hello. “I just wanted to show my friend the raft,” Neutrino said. “That all right?” We followed the man through the door, into a small, sleepy store that sold toys and children’s clothes and CD’s of Mexican singers and drinks, then through another door into a garage that had tires and tools spread around it, then into another dusty lot where there were a few trucks and beat-up and broken-down cars and, on a trailer, like a rare bird among a flock of sparrows, Neutrino’s raft. It was the first time I had seen it.</p></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Photo Block (column)--><div class="align-breaking-left marginalia"><!--This containing div will give us better contol of an accompanying caption once we add them--><img src="img/catfish.jpg" class="" /></div><!--End Photo Block--><!--Photo Block (left)--><!--Photo Block (right)--><!--Photo Block (left breaking)--><!--Photo Block (full width) NOTE: all blocks with full-width alignment specified need to break the .twelve and .container divs temporarily as shown below--><!--Photo Block (right breaking)--><!--End Photo Block--><!--Text Block--><span style=""><p>When I recall the moment, I feel my eyes widen. I expected a sleek, handmade craft, a stylish vessel, varnished and elegant, a craft to bear up to the life-and-death task being asked of it, and it was a scrappy, scuffed-up, bummy looking, broken-down wreck of doghouse on a floor of plywood. It looked like something a child had made. It had a flat bed, and there was a cabin about four feet tall at the back of it, and in front of the cabin a deck large enough for Neutrino to sit in a folding chair. No joint was tight. Where there were gaps, you could see pieces of drink coolers. Some of the plywood was new and some was splintered and peeling and had weathered to a dark gray. The back of the cabin was cut from a sign that Neutrino had painted in Key West for Katha Sheehan, a woman he met who was running for mayor. Sheehan and her husband had given him his van and his dog. Dark yellow letters on a yellow ground spelled “atha for ayor.” Screws were driven into the boards at angles, and the intervals between them were uneven.</p></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Photo Block (column)--><div class="align-breaking-left marginalia"><!--This containing div will give us better contol of an accompanying caption once we add them--><img src="img/CD.jpg" class="" /></div><!--End Photo Block--><!--Photo Block (left)--><!--Photo Block (right)--><!--Photo Block (left breaking)--><!--Photo Block (full width) NOTE: all blocks with full-width alignment specified need to break the .twelve and .container divs temporarily as shown below--><!--Photo Block (right breaking)--><!--End Photo Block--><!--Text Block--><span style=""><p>“How long did it take to build?” I asked.</p><p>“About four hours,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p>I nodded.&nbsp;</p><p>“I designed her for speed,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p>I wrote “Speed” in my notebook, then I underlined it, because I couldn’t think of anything to say.&nbsp;</p><p>“She’ll ride high in the water, just plane,” he said. He extended his hand slowly, with the palm toward the ground.&nbsp;</p><p>“The holes aren’t a problem?”&nbsp;</p><p>“Nope.”</p><p>Neutrino pointed to the place on the side of the cabin where he meant to build outriggers. Then we walked back through the garage and bought some bottled water from the woman at the store. Neutrino told the man he would send money for the next month’s rent. We got back in the van and drove toward Phoenix, and when we saw a motel from the highway I said, “That looks OK,” and we pulled off and I got a room. We ate dinner in a Mexican restaurant where there were a lot of families and a man who went around the room playing guitar and singing. Neutrino gave him five dollars and spoke to him in Spanish, and they settled on a song for him to sing.</p></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Photo Block (column)--><div class="align-column"><img src="img/Poppa_2.jpg" class="shadow" /></div><!--End Photo Block--><!--Photo Block (left)--><!--Photo Block (right)--><!--Photo Block (left breaking)--><!--Photo Block (full width) NOTE: all blocks with full-width alignment specified need to break the .twelve and .container divs temporarily as shown below--><!--Photo Block (right breaking)--><!--End Photo Block--><!--Text Block--><span style=""><p>Before I left Neutrino that night he wrote my name and room number on a sheet of paper and put it on the van’s dashboard, in case the motel checked the cars in its lot, then he walked the dog and went to sleep in the back of the van.</p><p>The next morning the road laid out in front of us like a carpet the color of tin.</p></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Photo Block (column)--><div class="align-column"><img src="img/Poppa_and_Alec.jpg" class="" /></div><!--End Photo Block--><!--Photo Block (left)--><!--Photo Block (right)--><!--Photo Block (left breaking)--><!--Photo Block (full width) NOTE: all blocks with full-width alignment specified need to break the .twelve and .container divs temporarily as shown below--><!--Photo Block (right breaking)--><!--End Photo Block--><!--Text Block--><br><div class="align-column"><img src="img/arrow.jpg" /></div><span style=""><p class="bio"><span class="bio-name">Alec Wilkinson</span> has been a writer at The New Yorker since 1980. &nbsp;Before that he was a rock and roll musician and before that he was a policeman in Wellfleet, Massachusetts, on Cape Cod. &nbsp;He has published ten books, including Big Sugar, A Violent Act, The Happiest Man in the World, and The Ice Balloon.</p></span><!--End Text Block--></div></div></article>
