<p class="dropcap">Fall is the season of melancholia. John Keats knew it. Dylan Thomas knew it. A time when the towns below are leaved with October blood. </p>

<p>People tend to confuse melancholia and depression. But to be melancholic is most certainly not to be depressed. It denotes a mournful state of thoughtfulness that is neither happiness nor sadness, exactly, but rather both at once. It makes it impossible to discriminate between the two states and asks you to question whether they exist apart from one another or if the former is really more desirable than the latter. </p>

<p>On an overcast October day, high in the mountains of central North Carolina, I found the most melancholy of places, the most fall-ish of places, a fantasyland half ruined by the passage of time and half overgrown by shrubs and leafy trees. The dilapidated Land of Oz theme park in the town of Beech Mountain was open from 1970–’80, and then it closed down as a result of a fire and a downturn in the real estate market. Ten years later, the park was restored to some of its glory and former employees began to hold yearly reunions through the 1990s. Those reunions eventually developed into the Autumn at Oz Festival, which opened the park to an adoring public. </p>
<blockquote class="align-full"><p>I wondered if the Land of Oz would have a glittering Emerald City: that place of promise, of kitsch where – at least in the film – all visitors get their hair curled before they meet the wizard.</p></blockquote>
<p>The crowds on this October morning were astonishing. The park is situated at the top of the town’s ski resort, so I waited in line at the base of the mountain for a bus that took me—and many others—up a winding road, lurching and groaning the whole way. There weren’t enough seats for everyone, so I stood in the aisle. We drove past vacation cabins flying American flags, and mailboxes in the shape of dogs, and lawn furniture overturned by the wind, to a place both ruined and trapped by time.</p>
<div class="align-breaking-left marginalia"><img src="img/squiggle_9.jpg" class="" /></div>
<p>I wondered if the Land of Oz would have a glittering Emerald City—that place of promise, that place of kitsch, that place where, at least in the film, all visitors get their hair curled before they meet the wizard. </p>

<p>The park was surrounded by an old fence and rusted barbed wire. This barrier was like the field of poppies in the film: something to keep you out. But the gate was open for this brief period, and vendors had set up T-shirt stands and face-painting booths. Tables were covered in bags of popcorn and cans of soda, and parents walked around with their children and swatted their ice-cream-covered hands away from the goods. </p>

<p>The Dorothys, Cowardly Lions and Wizards of all ages that poured off the bus testified to an obsessive love of the film—a need to be a part of it, really. To escape into a Technicolor universe so alien that it shakes you awake. A hostile forest. A crossroads in a field of wheat. But the world of the film is so perfectly curated, so controlled. This world was different. Decaying. But no one seemed to mind.</p>

<p>As I looked at all these thousands of people, I thought that this is a place of desire. These Dorothys with their Toto stuffed animals in baskets, these women in green face paint and prosthetic noses, these men wrapped in tin foil: they all wanted something. They wanted to walk down a road that leads to one certain place. A road that one could imagine as unmarked by other people. A road that is quite narrow at the start, just a dot, but then widens, gradually, spinning out in a circle and plunging you into the future.</p>
<div class="align-column"><img class="fade shadow" src="img/yellowbrickroad.jpg" /></div>
<p>The Yellow Brick Road wound along the mountaintop. It was narrow—more of a pathway than a road. I passed through Dorothy’s house to begin my stroll. The house was carefully designed to reflect its post-tornado state; it was built on a sharp angle, and objects—dishes, clothes, even furniture—lay scattered about. As I exited, I saw the Cowardly Lion off in the distance. The bricks of the road were faded, the yellow glaze worn away in places. On either side, park employees dressed as the film’s characters posed with young children. The wizard, in his Kansas incarnation as a traveling magician, chatted with several adults about his vacation plans. He held a crystal ball. </p>

<p>Families shuffled slowly along, marveling at everything they saw, and I slipped quietly and quickly along the edge of the pathway, stopping in places to survey the scene. <em>Excuse me; excuse me.</em> There were no rides or feature attractions. No shows or performances, so far as I could tell. Just the Yellow Brick Road, meandering along. Sometimes people lost their footing on the glaze, which was slick from the rain. </p>

<p>The park’s landscape was peppered with brightly colored mushroom sculptures that seem to have been imported from <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>. Garden gnomes stood sentinel on the tops of rocks. And Glenda’s pink bubble was perched atop a hill; it was smaller than I expected. Plastic, like a pool toy. I could see the seams where the pieces came together. They bunched a little, wrinkled. And silk flowers had been pressed into the damp soil, one by one, in an uneven line along the pathway, like a party garland. Soon, I thought, the flowers will be gathered up and put away, or else they will be left out in the snow. </p>
<blockquote class="align-full"><p>This yellow brick is my loot. Of course, you shouldn’t really loot from ruins. Mummies will attack you. Curses will find you.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Land of Oz is a ruin, a diminished thing. It stands for something that is lost. I brought something home from this ruin: a yellow brick. When I pick it up, it feels heavy in my hand, as if its heaviness should stand for something more than heaviness, as if it should stand for the past. This yellow brick is my loot. Of course, you shouldn’t really loot at ruins. Mummies will attack you. Curses will find you. People did it in the past—many explorers and archaeologists, gentlemen who thought they could lay claim to all things. No, I did not really loot my brick. It seems that the Yellow Brick Road has been repaired a number of times over the years, and the park sells the old bricks to fund new repairs. There was a stack of these 1970s bricks, maybe a few dozen, at the exit to the park. So I paid my $5, and a woman wrapped one in a paper towel, and I carried it away in my purse. </p>
<div class="align-breaking-left marginalia"><img src="img/squiggle_21.jpg" class="" /></div>
<p>Now this brick is on the sideboard in my dining room. It is out of context, a souvenir removed from its fantasyland. When I look at it, I imagine that I can build up a whole world around it, a world that would be the Land of Oz theme park as it used to be: glossy and new. This unit, this thing: its history is mapped in things I can’t see. The soles of shoes, and the glitter of girls’ costumes, and rotten leaves.</p>

<p>There was a plastic, pale-green lantern above the stone archway of the park’s exit. The lantern wasn’t lit. Maybe it was, at some point, on past evenings. As I walked under the lantern, I sensed that I needed to leave this place. It was hilarious, in a way, but also horrible, like a distorting mirror in a fun house. </p>

<p>There was a very long line for the bus going down the mountain. I saw two people getting into a car in the vendor parking lot, and I rushed up to them and asked if they would mind very much giving me a ride, and they said no, get in. And as we drove past houses and mailboxes and other proofs of life, I thought, <em>I will never come back here.</em> Not because I won’t wonder what happens to this park over time, but because I knew I was in a haunted place, and you shouldn’t go back to a place you know is haunted.</p>
