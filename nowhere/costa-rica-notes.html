<h2 class="subheading">1. A Catalog of the Cloud Forest</h2>
<p class="dropcap">Leaf-cutter ants live in underground lairs known as fungus gardens. The success rate for young queens starting out is very low, but for the small percentage that survives, their underground nests can grow more than 98 feet in circumference beneath the cloud-forest floor. Beautiful as they carry bright scraps of leaves like tiny flags, her blind workers are both corralled and protected by the larger soldiers.</p>
<p>The millipede releases cyanide when you touch him, and this poison smells not so much of almonds, but of something sweeter—amaretto, like your teenage sours.</p>
<div class="align-breaking-left marginalia"><img class="" src="img/4.jpg" /></div>
<p>The sloth descends from its tree once a week to shit. It then becomes slow-moving prey for jaguars, serpents and ocelot. Here is a happier story: the rest of the time, it rests in the limbs eating leaves, its fur growing moss and lichen, a moveable landscape home to colonies of shiny backed beetles.</p>
<p>Agouti is a type of wild rodent.</p>
<p>Peccaries (also known as javelinas and skunk pigs) have three-chambered stomachs and their tusks are short and strong, adapted to crush hard seeds and slice thick plant roots. In recent years, packs of the beasts have attacked and killed humans. When they rub their tusks together, it makes a kind of chattering music. Dice rattling in a cup; a rain of dry bones falling on a marble floor.</p>
<p>The fer-de-lance tricks you into thinking its scales are velvety.</p>
<p>A bevy of hummingbirds is also called a troubling. When they fly around your face in a flurry, their tiny wings buzz like feathered machines.</p>
<p>The pit viper is the hummingbird’s primary predator in this area, followed by domestic household cats brave or hungry enough to venture into the vines. The viper drapes itself (a spring-leaf-green sheen) over low-hanging branches—about knee level—in the shape of a bisected infinity loop. Here it waits to rise and strike the birds as they fly.</p>
<blockquote class="align-full"><p>The viper drapes itself over low-hanging branches in the shape of a bisected infinity loop.</p></blockquote>
<p>Deinopidae are also called net-casting or ogre-faced spiders. They spin webs between their front legs and, when prey approaches, propel themselves forward to catch the unwary in their nets.</p>
<p>The strangling fig tree, or ficus, germinates on other trees. The seedlings stretch their branches simultaneously down for water and up to blossom in the sunlight, slowly enveloping their hosts. Eventually the embrace chokes the support tree and the ficus becomes a beautiful wooden filigree wrapped around a dead trunk.</p>


<div class="align-column"><img class="" src="img/2.jpg" /></div>
<h2 class="subheading">2. Direction</h2>
<p class="dropcap">There is a compass inked on your forearm with juice from a berry-pulped magenta. It was drawn there delicately with a twig—an eight-pointed star. The only direction José writes is a solitary N crowning the star. “You must never forget your north,” he says.</p>
<div class="align-breaking-left marginalia"><img class="" src="img/squiggle_23.jpg" /></div>
<p>If you carry a compass on your skin, how can you lose yourself? When you shower, will it slip down the drain? Or has it sunk into your skin to hide like a secret Polaris, resting in a nest of bones, nerves and tendons?</p>
<p>Seven years ago you wrote a story in which you promised that nothing was ever truly lost. Now you are older and know that everything can, and will, be stripped away. That’s just how the world is. And someone you wrote it for is about to break your heart. Not romantically, but in the same vein.</p>


<div class="align-column"><img class="" src="img/3.jpg" /></div>
<h2 class="subheading">3. Salvage</h2>
<p class="dropcap">Your arrival in Puntarenas feels like the first page of a Graham Greene novel. The port town is long past its days of glory. The coastal stretch is deserted like an old film still of Greta Garbo’s face: sharp angles and silence. The decay is elegant, raffish almost, and you walk past buildings whose peeling façades peer at you from behind gates topped with barbed wire.</p>
<p>You are staying in a wooden mansion from the 1920s, restored from ruin by its owners. La Perla de Pacifico; you found it in your friend’s guidebook. For some reason or another the only German word you know is hexenmeister (wizard), and so, before you arrived, you kept telling David the place would be magic. It is the kind of joke that seems secretly true: the munificence of the cloud forest primed your arcane powers.</p>
<p>You find your magical German host when you arrive. He is lounging on the veranda in flesh-colored underwear. His hair is long and white, and his voice, as he offers you a cocktail, is deep and calm. His name is Michael and his wife, Elisabeth, is a French painter of moderate international renown. Her work shimmers like stained-glass windows against the white walls.</p>
<p>The mansion has 49 doors and, it seems, at least as many windows. It is a treasure chest, or, perhaps more accurately, a life-sized Joseph Cornell box. A Victrola’s golden horn rises like a flower from its dark case. A statue of Ganesha rests on the dining room sideboard. The front door opens to a set of marble stairs, and just past them is a Jacuzzi embedded in the center of the house like a watery heart. Under the kitchen window lives a caiman.</p>
<div class="align-column"><img class="" src="img/1.jpg" /></div>
<p>Next door, an ornate building slowly crumbles, low tide revealing gaping cracks in its foundation. La Perla is on stronger stone stilts. You can see them at low tide. The land between the mansion and the ghost house was once a trash heap, but Michael and Elisabeth emptied the trash and filled the space with twin cats and three guard dogs, a wood-burning oven and a few small sculptures of witches. The garden is also home to a series of plants that inevitably die as soon as their roots reach saltwater. “They are looking for something they want, they think is nourishment, but then the roots, they poison themselves,” Michael says.</p>
<p>The four-poster bed in your room is draped in white mosquito netting and when you settle inside for the night the fan blows the netting back and forth. You watch it rustle as others might watch waves washing up on a beach.</p>
<blockquote class="align-full"><p>The land between the mansion and the ghost house was once a trash heap</p></blockquote>
<div class="align-breaking-left marginalia"><img class="" src="img/ganesh.png" /></div>
<p>In the morning, the hosts have promised to take you on their boat, a wooden beauty they built from scratch—gleaming hull, wicker roof, one small triangle missing in the prow where a carved dragon’s head from Thailand will eventually sit.</p>
<p>Later, the hexenmeister will hold your hands briefly and stare into your eyes as you stand at his door, bound for the train station. “Have a wonderful life,” he tells you, and it feels like a charge as well as a blessing. It is early summer, the rainy season, and the skies are thick with moisture and heat. The moon glows whiter than you have ever seen.</p>
<p>“Their boat is a dragon,” you whisper to your friend as he sleeps and the mosquito netting ripples like the wake behind a ship.</p>
