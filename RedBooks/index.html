But when it came time to get to the hardest and which brand to use going forward — the parties knew they needed help. They turned to a brand consultancy to advise them and smooth the process.

Instead of relying on an imprecise and emotional process, she turned to brand valuation. A rapidresponse group came together and, after a few late nights and awful redeye flights, put together a complete picture of the real value of each brand.The effect was magical. Faced with credible data showing that one brand was stronger in the business-to-business world while the other was better suited to the consumer marketplace, the teams let go of their entrenched and opposing positions. Real answers and hard numbers made the way forward clear to even the most emotionally attached team members. One brand would sit atop the business-to-business division and the other would carry the consumer business.&nbsp;</p><p>Stories like this are becoming increasingly common, but soon, brand valuation will be more than just a last-ditch tool or an occasional exercise. Brand valuation is taking up residence in the marketing department, disrupting it. A new age of brand valuation is coming. When valuation’s potential is fully realized, the nature of decision making will change because it will be possible to link brand and marketing to real money.Brand valuation provides a strong financial rationale for strategicrecommendations and budget requests. When that happens, the corporate perspective on brand and marketing shifts. Brands become leverageable assets. Marketing acquires a new credibility - one that enables it to takeits rightful place in the boardroom.&nbsp;</p><p>Ogilvy &amp; Mather’s clients often ask us to advise them on brand valuation methodology, as they struggle to demonstrate the business impact of marketing and to justify their budgets in a cost conscious world.

Until now, brand valuation has had a built-in accounting bias, stunting its usefulness for marketing. The approach and mindset of brand valuation originated with accountants and has not evolved. Brand valuation — even in a marketing context — has remained narrow, focused on a single number, and largely non-strategic. It has been the preserve of brand consulting and design firms, which are small businesses with a relatively narrow focus. Leading practitioners of brand valuation in companies such as Interbrand and Brand Finance are accountants by training and outlook, separated off by P&amp;Ls and organization structure from the wider world of marketing. Behind closed doors, they have developed arcane formulas for valuation. These formulas have become black boxes, mysterious in content, jealously guarded and presented as proprietary. Brand valuation has come to be seen as a dark art, the preserve of a small number of specialists. Nothing could be further from the truth.</p></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Text Block--><span style=""><p>Several brand consulting companies make some big claims about their brand valuation offers. They are “Changing the way the world thinks about brands;” “Maximizing returns on brand and marketing investments;” “Optimizing shareholder value;” and “Bridging the gap between marketing and finance.” While we believe that brand valuation does indeed have the potential to change the way companies think about brand management and brand investment and can put the relationship between marketing and finance on a new footing, achieving those promises will require going well beyond the current approaches. In fact, we want to counter the status quo of today’s brand valuation — perhaps even shatter it. Companies should not be satisfied with brand survey rankings or other snapshot approaches. They are an illusion.</p></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Text Block--><span style=""><p>To understand the potential of brand valuation, it’s worth looking back to its roots. How it originated has much to do with why it remains underutilized and what must change to make it useful. We have a new way of thinking about brand valuation, one that goes back to fundamentals — what brands are, and how they drive value creation and business growth. With that as a base, we can change the way in which valuation is applied, making it a practical tool for use by any marketer. Brand valuation needs to shed its black box present to become an open-source tool. It must transition from a snapshot to a longitudinal view, from a narrow to a holistic measurement of value, from a pass/fail judgment to a diagnostic and strategic tool. We won’t claim that Ogilvy &amp; Mather is the only practitioner capable of delivering on brand valuation analysis. In fact, we believe that the approach we define here can be followed by any organization that makes a commitment to strategic brand investment. But we do promise it will deliver a far more objective valuation of brands than typical global survey rankings.</p></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Photo Block (column)--><div class="align-edge-right"><!--This containing div will give us better contol of an accompanying caption once we add them--><img src="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/dbzM0GqTfWUzMgkk5KMg?signature=b27ff19f30657670f4edca9056ed3841ed4d69374c3034ba8f4b57f9a363d47c&policy=eyJjYWxsIjogWyJyZWFkIiwgImNvbnZlcnQiXSwgImV4cGlyeSI6ICIyNTI0NjU4NDAwIn0=" class="" /><p class="caption"></p></div><!--End Photo Block--><!--Photo Block (left)--><!--Photo Block (right)--><!--Photo Block (left breaking)--><!--Photo Block (full width) NOTE: all blocks with full-width alignment specified need to break the .twelve and .container divs temporarily as shown below--><!--Photo Block (right breaking)--><!--End Photo Block--><!--Text Block--><span style=""><p>There is an opportunity to integrate brand valuation into the day-to-day practice of marketing.

It was invented by investment bankers as a method of acquisition accounting. The idea originated in the UK in the 1980s, following a wave of takeovers of consumer packaged-goods companies. The acquirers in each case paid a significant premium over the tangible assets on the balance sheet of the purchased company. These premiums recognized the additional intangible value of the company’s brands. However, since intangibles couldn’t be recognized on the balance sheet, these acquisitions created huge amounts of “goodwill” (purchase price premium over book value) that had to be recognized in the balance sheet. The result was either large amortization charges or large write-offs. The frustration surrounding this sparked a debate about how to quantify the value of brands in an acquisition and separate off the amount paid for the brand from the total amount of goodwill.</p></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Text Block--><span style=""><strong><p>Accountants</p></strong></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Text Block--><span style=""><p>Accountants were the next generation of brand valuers; they aimed to use brand valuation to reduce their clients’ corporate taxes. This practice began with what became a near obsession — the idea of “putting the brand on the balance sheet.” Although there was a serious concept behind this — the idea that brands are value-adding assets — valuations were conducted solely for the purpose of recording a number that would result in accounting and tax advantages.</p></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Text Block--><span style=""><p>Brand valuation of this kind remains very much alive. Accounting for brands has evolved from a patchwork of rules to two sets of very similar standards, one US (GAAP) and the other for the rest of the world (IFRS).</p></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Text Block--><span style=""><p>This has led to a massive increase in the numbers of brand valuations conducted solely for balance-sheet reporting and compliance purposes. These valuations are generally conducted by the large accounting firms, which have a somewhat cavalier attitude to reporting brand value. For them, brand valuation is a purely financial exercise, without involvement of marketing departments or corporate strategy, and, consequently, without any thought for the future. While it may have short-term benefits, this practice can be dangerous and costly. Accountants have rushed to put brands at high values on balance sheets when acquisitions are made, only to find that marketing departments havesubsequently eliminated those same brands, causing huge write-offs.</p></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Photo Block (column)--></div></div><div class="align-full"><img src="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/s5qfbxncQfGMbHOE63vm?signature=b27ff19f30657670f4edca9056ed3841ed4d69374c3034ba8f4b57f9a363d47c&policy=eyJjYWxsIjogWyJyZWFkIiwgImNvbnZlcnQiXSwgImV4cGlyeSI6ICIyNTI0NjU4NDAwIn0=" class="" /><p class="caption"></p></div><div class="container"><div class="twelve columns offset-by-two"><!--End Photo Block--><!--Photo Block (left)--><!--Photo Block (right)--><!--Photo Block (left breaking)--><!--Photo Block (full width) NOTE: all blocks with full-width alignment specified need to break the .twelve and .container divs temporarily as shown below--><!--Photo Block (right breaking)--><!--End Photo Block--><!--Text Block--><span style=""><p>Following on the heels of the accountants, international tax experts devised yet more ways to use brand valuation to reduce corporate tax bills. In their most advanced form, these include the creation of separate brand-holding companies for the management of the brand asset. In this arrangement, ownership of the global brand is sold to the holding company, which is located in a low-tax jurisdiction. The brand and certain brand management and marketing functions are then licensed back to the corporation’s subsidiaries, in return for an annual royalty fee. Clearly, this is financial engineering, not brand value creation.</p></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Text Block--><span style=""><p>The financial origin of brand valuation has its good points. Because it came out of the financial function, brand valuation has credibility with accountants and analysts. The concept has been enshrined in accounting rules and approved by standards bodies. However, this financial bias has limited the application of brand valuation. The goals are narrow — reducing the goodwill in mergers and acquisitions, creating additional assets for accounting purposes, or reducing international tax burdens.All of these are very specific, single-purpose use cases, and all require only a single, simple measure — one financial number. This provides a snapshot of brand value at a single point in time, with no link back into the business.

The value of a brand is established by comparing it to other brands whose value has already been established in the marketplace.</p></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Text Block--><span style=""><p>The most common example of this is comparables-based brand valuation. This method looks at how much similar brands were sold for. The simplest version just uses a number for the brand being valued; more sophisticated approaches calculate a multiple — say brand value per dollar of revenue, or brand value per dollar of EBITDA — and use that as the basis for valuation.</p></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Text Block--><span style=""><p>Unfortunately, you will find it very difficult, and often impossible, to find truly comparable brand transactions. And if you do, it is highly unlikely that you can learn how the brand value number was determined.

Comparables, which in this case are derived from licensing deals for other brands. Unfortunately, the brand licensing market lacks transparency and sophistication. Comparables reflect the balance of power between particular licensors and licensees at the time of negotiation rather than the intrinsic value of the brand. As a result, valuations based on royalty relief calculations tend to undervalue the brand and favor the licensee over the licensor.</p></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Text Block--><span style=""><p>The market approaches may be full of holes, but they are based on a clear principle — an attempt to get at what the market would be willing to pay.

The most obviously flawed is the cost-based approach. The idea is that a brand can be valued as the sum of the marketing and advertising costs incurred to build the brand or of the replacement cost if the brand had to be built from scratch today.</p></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Text Block--><span style=""><p>There are two major problems. First, it assumes that advertising spending can be guaranteed to build brand value. This is by no means always the case. The most extreme examples occurred during the <a href="http://dot.com" rel="nofollow">dot.com</a> boom. In 2000, Internet businesses are estimated to have spent over $3 billion on TV and sponsorships. Today, most of these brands have disappeared. More traditional businesses have also paid out huge sums on advertising without producing commensurate results.</p></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Text Block--><span style=""><p>The second fallacy of the cost-based approach is that it presupposes that brands are built only through investment in advertising. That’s less true today than it ever was. A brand is the result of many different types of investment: advertising and marketing, as well as R&amp;D, product design, and every aspect of the customer experience.

The answer is discouraging: they have no interest in seeing what lies behind the number. The finance profession is unconcerned with brands, caring instead about using a brand valuation number to game accounting and tax regulations. Their methods meet accounting standards, but you can’t do anything with them. They record value; they cannot create it.</p></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Text Block--><span style=""><strong><p>The economic-use approach</p></strong></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Text Block--><span style=""><p>A foundation has been laid for a new direction.

These brand-created cash flows are then discounted back to a present value based on a risk factor of the brand’s durability.</p></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Text Block--><span style=""><p>Economic use is inherently more accurate than other methodologies, since it is based on data about the business using the brand, rather than data about other brands. It creates the possibility of drilling down into the drivers of brand value, allowing the sources of value to be identified. This means that it can be used not just as a financial tool that provides a pointin- time brand value number but also as a management tool to identify the strategies that will best increase the value the brand adds to the business.</p></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Photo Block (column)--><div class="align-column"><!--This containing div will give us better contol of an accompanying caption once we add them--><img src="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/3Os6Tk3ITZCXXc769OaK?signature=b27ff19f30657670f4edca9056ed3841ed4d69374c3034ba8f4b57f9a363d47c&policy=eyJjYWxsIjogWyJyZWFkIiwgImNvbnZlcnQiXSwgImV4cGlyeSI6ICIyNTI0NjU4NDAwIn0=" class="" /><p class="caption"></p></div><!--End Photo Block--><!--Photo Block (left)--><!--Photo Block (right)--><!--Photo Block (left breaking)--><!--Photo Block (full width) NOTE: all blocks with full-width alignment specified need to break the .twelve and .container divs temporarily as shown below--><!--Photo Block (right breaking)--><!--End Photo Block--></div></div></article><!-- <nav class="pagination container"><div class="twelve columns offset-by-two"><a href="" class="pagination__button -prev glyphicons chevron-left"></a><a href="" class="pagination__item">1</a><a href="" class="pagination__item -current">2</a><a href="" class="pagination__item">3</a><a href="" class="pagination__item">4</a><a href="" class="pagination__button -next glyphicons chevron-right"></a></div></nav>   -->

Although the number of specialist firms is small, each group has its own black box. There are at least 39 different brand valuation models used by over 60 different sets of practitioners. Even when the methodologies are conceptually similar (which is by no means always the case), there are enough differences to ensure that they will produce different numbers. This has done a lot to discredit brand valuation in some markets, especially Germany and Spain. A famous study entitled “How nine experts evaluate a fictitious brand” was published in the German business magazine, Die Tank. Nine firms were given identical information on an imaginary brand and asked to value it. With their nine different methodologies, they came up with nine different answers, ranging in value from 173 million to 958 million euros.</p></em></strong></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Text Block--><span style=""><p>Accusations of inaccuracy bedevil brand valuation rankings as well. The figures published by Interbrand differ from those published by BrandZ™. In 2012, for example, Interbrand’s valuation of the Apple brand came out at $77 billion, 58% less than BrandZ’s $183 billion. Differences in valuations included in rankings published by BrandZ, Interbrand, Brand Finance, and Eurobrand range from a minimum of 30% (HP, American Express) to a factor of more than four (McDonald’s, Shell).</p></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Text Block--><span style=""><p>The crux of the brand valuation issue is this: Its role in marketing today is little different from its role in accounting. It only gives a point-in-time value, and so the major use of brand valuation is benchmarking.</p></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Text Block--><span style=""><p>Almost every large company at some time or other has conducted a proprietary brand valuation exercise. The objective is usually to produce a new brand measurement metric. A financial number for the brand is seen as a superior KPI compared to market research metrics. These brand valuations are based on internal data and can therefore be segmented to a much greater level of detail than published rankings. You end up with a whole lot of brand value numbers. This would be great if they were useful. Depending on the segmentation scheme, there may be one valuation number for each division, for each product/service, and for each customer segment, further divided into geographical markets in which the company operates, and rolled up into composite numbers for the company as awhole. But point-in-time numbers like this just aren’t actionable. And so, while the original intent is to leverage valuation for other purposes, it rarely happens — leading many clients to drop brand valuation after doing it once or twice.</p></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Text Block--><span style=""><p>Clients also move away from proprietary brand valuations since they feel they can get as good or better benchmarking results by following one of the major published rankings. While brand rankings have been around, on and off since 1995, their popularity has soared with the emergence of BrandZ and the Financial Times as a counterpart to Interbrand and Business Week. Downloads from WPP’s BrandZ database have more than doubled since the first ranking came out.</p></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Text Block--><span style=""><p>The rankings draw the attention of CEOs, CFOs, and the financial community to the fact that brands have value — in some cases, a great deal of value. The threshold for entry into the latest Interbrand Best Global Brands was just under $4 billion; for the 2013 BrandZ Top 100, it was over$8 billion. The top brands score in the $70–180 billion range, which makes them worth more than the GDPs of many mid-sized countries.</p></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Text Block--><span style=""><p>Many companies have elevated these rankings to godlike arbiters of performance. The ranking number (and even more so the brand’s position in the ranking) is used as a pass/fail judgment on CMOs, consultants, and agencies, and in some cases is built into the KPIs and performance management of top marketing executives.</p></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Photo Block (column)--><div class="align-breaking-left"><!--This containing div will give us better contol of an accompanying caption once we add them--><img src="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/P9htG9xvSqSL8pEMNqNk?signature=b27ff19f30657670f4edca9056ed3841ed4d69374c3034ba8f4b57f9a363d47c&policy=eyJjYWxsIjogWyJyZWFkIiwgImNvbnZlcnQiXSwgImV4cGlyeSI6ICIyNTI0NjU4NDAwIn0=" class="" /><p class="caption"></p></div><!--End Photo Block--><!--Photo Block (left)--><!--Photo Block (right)--><!--Photo Block (left breaking)--><!--Photo Block (full width) NOTE: all blocks with full-width alignment specified need to break the .twelve and .container divs temporarily as shown below--><!--Photo Block (right breaking)--><!--End Photo Block--><!--Text Block--><span style=""><p>Care should be taken in placing too much reliance on rankings, even as benchmarks. Rankings are inevitably “a mile wide and an inch deep.” When hundreds of brands are being valued, some accuracy is sacrificed, even by the most conscientious professionals. Interbrand’s ranking, for example, is conducted at a global level only, without looking into countries or categories. While the financial numbers are solid, the portion attributable to the brand itself is determined qualitatively, by Interbrand’s leaders, who debate each brand’s merits in a two-weeklong meeting. BrandZ is more robust — financials are built up from sales data, by market and by category. They calculate the brand portion by analysis of quantitative brand equity data, from an annual BrandZ study conducted in 433 categories and over 30 countries. But even here there are issues — the brand equity sample is not always stable and valuations can be disproportionately impacted by short-term fluctuations in share price. Brand Finance’s ranking is the most consistent and predictable...and the least interesting. Standard royalty rates are applied to market cap for brands in each category, making the brand values a mirror image of share price; brand strength and equity are ignored.</p></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Text Block--><span style=""><p>For brand valuation to progress beyond benchmarking and be of real use, it must no longer be considered in isolation from marketing. Instead of being just a number, it must become a diagnostic tool. Numbers change every day.

If brand valuation is to be adopted as a strategic tool, we have to make the methodology available to all. Only when this happens will brand valuation be fully accepted by the financial function. Today, many CFOs are suspicious of it, and rightly so.</p></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Text Block--><span style=""><p>The current lack of transparency exists for a number of reasons. Part of it is the tendency of small, specialty consultancies to clutch their specialty closely to their chests and exaggerate the proprietary nature of what they do (particularly when their senior people are trained accountants). Part of it is that there may truly be something to hide. This is usually related to the most critical part of the methodology — the process used to isolate the portion of value that is attributed to brand. For some brand valuation consultancies, there is no data behind the calculation — only qualitative estimates based on “our experience.” In other words, the brand contribution is arrived at through statistical analysis of market research. However, samples are often unstable and correlations frequently do not work — producing results that are nonsensical and cannot be replicated. We believe there is work to be done to improve the methodology; it will happen faster and better in the light of day, with openness and transparency.</p></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Text Block--><span style=""><strong><p>Start with how brand creates value, and drive the methodology from there</p></strong></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Text Block--><span style=""><p>The whole point of brand valuation is that brands make money for their owners. People will pay more for an Hermès bag than for the copy, no matter how accurate it is. To exploit the full potential of brand valuation, we must begin by understanding what brands are and how they make money. What is it about a brand that is valuable? How does a brand impact the business? How does this result in more financial value than the business would have without investing in brand? Without an understanding of the sources of value, brand valuation is limited to being an exercise to produce a point-in-time number.</p></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Text Block--><span style=""><p>The first step is to define brand, in a way that makes sense both to accountants and to brand managers. Technically, brand has two components:</p></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Text Block--><span style=""><p>Brand = Reputation + Identity.</p></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Text Block--><span style=""><p>Reputation (or Equity): Psychological benefits resulting from a particular set of associations in the mind of customers or other stakeholders. These differentiate it from competitors and create a promise of future performance. By delivering on this promise, reputation is created. It is reputation that is the source of value.</p></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Text Block--><span style=""><p>Identity: A clear and simple mark, with concrete and legally defensibleattributes. This is how brand originated — from the red-hot iron used to stamp the owners’ name on cattle. For a brand to create sustainable value, it must have an identity that can be protected. However, the point of an identity is to identify. That’s all it does. An identity or trademark does not by itself create value. It is a visual and verbal organizing principle and system.</p></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Text Block--><span style=""><p>Reputation and identity come together to create brand by offering the guaranteed delivery on a clearly identified promise. The reputations of the most valuable brands are built on promises that have a higher purpose. They go beyond the product, beyond the category, to stand for a universal human ideal. This purpose is reflected in a strong visual and verbal identity extending past the logo to consistent implementation in every product and at every touch point.</p></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Text Block--><span style=""><p>David Ogilvy helped create both the reputation and identity of one of the world’s great brands — Dove. His agency has been building and protecting that brand since it was first launched in 1955 — from development of its distinctive mark to the higher purpose of Real Beauty, which has not only lifted sales and profits but led to a worldwide movement to promote a healthy self-image in women. David Ogilvy’s legacy continues at IBM, where the ideal of using technology to make the world a better place has been realized through the Smarter Planet brand communications platform and brand visual identity, creating the world’s most valuable B2B brand. Many other brands — from Coca-Cola to Nike to BMW — have built their value by defining a higher brand purpose and communicating it through an iconic brand identity. None — at least in the consumer world — has done it better than Apple, which drives its ideal of empowering “individual creativity and self-expression” through an instantly recognizable brand identity — disruptive, intuitive, and personal.</p></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Text Block--><span style=""><p>Brand can also be thought of as both cause and effect. The brand promise is a cause or point of view put forward by the company which causes stakeholders to think differently about its offering and impacts their behavior toward it. Brand reputation is a result, an effect of everything that happens in the business. Brand is created and managed through the experience — the points at which the company interacts with customers, potential customers, and other stakeholders. Brand establishes a nonrational hold over the behavior of the stakeholder, which leads them to prefer the company’s offer to competitors’. This creates a co-relationship between the stakeholder and the company, guaranteeing a flow of future sales and profits.</p></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Text Block--><span style=""><p>Brand is different from other assets in that it acquires a power and existence of its own. The unique power of brand lies in its ability to transfer loyalty across products, services, and categories. Brand can be separated from the operations of the company and franchised and licensed to third parties for use in new situations. Leon Leonwood Bean would, no doubt, be surprised to know that his brand, L.L. Bean, helped increase the outdoor credibility of a Japanese carmaker.</p></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Text Block--><span style=""><p>Brands impact the demand side of the business (revenues and margins) suppliers, regulators, and investors).

This piece of market research, generally conducted among the brand’s target customers, uncovers the reasons why a customer decides to purchase a particular product or service rather than that of a competitor and what role the brand plays in that decision.</p></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Photo Block (column)--><div class="align-edge-left"><!--This containing div will give us better contol of an accompanying caption once we add them--><img src="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/21RgZPzERfe8EYzGLC6B?signature=b27ff19f30657670f4edca9056ed3841ed4d69374c3034ba8f4b57f9a363d47c&policy=eyJjYWxsIjogWyJyZWFkIiwgImNvbnZlcnQiXSwgImV4cGlyeSI6ICIyNTI0NjU4NDAwIn0=" class="" /><p class="caption"></p></div><!--End Photo Block--><!--Photo Block (left)--><!--Photo Block (right)--><!--Photo Block (left breaking)--><!--Photo Block (full width) NOTE: all blocks with full-width alignment specified need to break the .twelve and .container divs temporarily as shown below--><!--Photo Block (right breaking)--><!--End Photo Block--><!--Photo Block (column)--><div class="align-column"><!--This containing div will give us better contol of an accompanying caption once we add them--><img src="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/oOQFShxPQM2ZVmA5REep?signature=b27ff19f30657670f4edca9056ed3841ed4d69374c3034ba8f4b57f9a363d47c&policy=eyJjYWxsIjogWyJyZWFkIiwgImNvbnZlcnQiXSwgImV4cGlyeSI6ICIyNTI0NjU4NDAwIn0=" class="" /><p class="caption"></p></div><!--End Photo Block--><!--Photo Block (left)--><!--Photo Block (right)--><!--Photo Block (left breaking)--><!--Photo Block (full width) NOTE: all blocks with full-width alignment specified need to break the .twelve and .container divs temporarily as shown below--><!--Photo Block (right breaking)--><!--End Photo Block--><!--Image Assets Block--><ul class="image-assets row"></ul><!--End Image Assets Block--><!--Photo Block (column)--><div class="align-column"><!--This containing div will give us better contol of an accompanying caption once we add them--><img src="" class="" /><p class="caption"></p></div><!--End Photo Block--><!--Photo Block (left)--><!--Photo Block (right)--><!--Photo Block (left breaking)--><!--Photo Block (full width) NOTE: all blocks with full-width alignment specified need to break the .twelve and .container divs temporarily as shown below--><!--Photo Block (right breaking)--><!--End Photo Block--></div></div></article><!-- <nav class="pagination container"><div class="twelve columns offset-by-two"><a href="" class="pagination__button -prev glyphicons chevron-left"></a><a href="" class="pagination__item">1</a><a href="" class="pagination__item -current">2</a><a href="" class="pagination__item">3</a><a href="" class="pagination__item">4</a><a href="" class="pagination__button -next glyphicons chevron-right"></a></div></nav>   -->

Brand can play a large role in attracting and retaining employees. Companies with strong brands such as Google or Goldman Sachs are able to hire the most qualified employees more easily, pay them less, and retain them longer. In return, employees play a major role in creating (or destroying) brand value through their interactions with customers and potential customers. There is a huge and overlooked opportunity to grow brand value among employees — the Gallup Business Journal noted that a study of 3000 workers found that 60% of them did not believe in their company’s brands.</p></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Text Block--><span style=""><p>Brand valuation should also expand its scope beyond the demand side of the business to examine every way in which the brand creates value. Yes, it drives higher demand for a company’s products and services, but we can also assess its impact on the supply side of the business, including working capital, capital investment, and borrowing costs. A company with a strong brand may be able to pay its suppliers later, and get its customer to pay earlier, than a company with a weaker brand. A valuable brand can be leveraged to minimize the costs and risks of expanding to new categories and markets. Instead of making the capital investment itself, the company can license its brand to a third party and receive a risk-free stream of royalty rates — pure profit — in return. Some successful businesses, such as Calvin Klein, have been built entirely by this means. Brands can even create value analysts’ willingness to recommend the stock and earning additional basis points on their stock and bond prices.</p></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Photo Block (column)--><div class="align-breaking-right"><!--This containing div will give us better contol of an accompanying caption once we add them--><img src="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/mRdL8nqhROOzh9VUJJQg?signature=b27ff19f30657670f4edca9056ed3841ed4d69374c3034ba8f4b57f9a363d47c&policy=eyJjYWxsIjogWyJyZWFkIiwgImNvbnZlcnQiXSwgImV4cGlyeSI6ICIyNTI0NjU4NDAwIn0=" class="" /><p class="caption"></p></div><!--End Photo Block--><!--Photo Block (left)--><!--Photo Block (right)--><!--Photo Block (left breaking)--><!--Photo Block (full width) NOTE: all blocks with full-width alignment specified need to break the .twelve and .container divs temporarily as shown below--><!--Photo Block (right breaking)--><!--End Photo Block--><!--Text Block--><span style=""><strong><p>Look at many measures</p></strong></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Text Block--><span style=""><p>To become strategic, brand valuation must encompass many measures, not just one. Today, everyone is fixated on “the number.” More meaningful and actionable measures need to be added. The percentage contribution of brand to value is, for example, a better measure of brand effectiveness than total brand value. The brand valuation number on its own doesn’t take the size of the pie into consideration. A large brand such as GE may have more brand value than Louis Vuitton, even though brand contributes only 18% of GE’s value versus 80% of Louis Vuitton’s value, simply because one is a much larger business than the other. Different metrics should cover the key drivers of brand value creation, related to differentiation and competitive advantage, among others. These metrics should be easy to understand, easily replicated, and forward-looking leading indicators of brand value creation. They must include a linkage between brand and share price — the indispensable condition for getting brand into the boardroom.</p></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Photo Block (column)--><div class="align-breaking-left"><!--This containing div will give us better contol of an accompanying caption once we add them--><img src="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/YzPCQ8aARKGJe5d4X6C0?signature=b27ff19f30657670f4edca9056ed3841ed4d69374c3034ba8f4b57f9a363d47c&policy=eyJjYWxsIjogWyJyZWFkIiwgImNvbnZlcnQiXSwgImV4cGlyeSI6ICIyNTI0NjU4NDAwIn0=" class="" /><p class="caption"></p></div><!--End Photo Block--><!--Photo Block (left)--><!--Photo Block (right)--><!--Photo Block (left breaking)--><!--Photo Block (full width) NOTE: all blocks with full-width alignment specified need to break the .twelve and .container divs temporarily as shown below--><!--Photo Block (right breaking)--><!--End Photo Block--><!--Text Block--><span style=""><strong><p>Look over time — the new brand tracking</p></strong></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Text Block--><span style=""><p>To be truly useful, brand valuation must shift from a point-in-time measurement to measurement over time. Conducting brand valuation once is a “nice-to-have.” If it is diagnostic, it can provide important input to strategy development. But the real ROI on brand valuation comes when the company’s progress in creating brand value is tracked on an annual basis.</p></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Text Block--><span style=""><p>Traditional brand health tracking has lost a lot of credibility. Too often, brand-tracking studies are big, slow, and expensive. Their constructs are complicated, their metrics intermediate and lagging. With their reams of PowerPoint slides, they seem increasingly irrelevant, devoid of actionable insights for the business, and with little meaning outside the marketing department, or perhaps even the market research department. Many companies, to their shame, are stopping tracking their brands with any regularity.</p></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Text Block--><span style=""><p>Brand valuation has the potential to resurrect brand tracking by taking it to a higher level, making it relevant and actionable for the business. It measures the success of brand initiatives in terms that everyone in the company cares about — revenue and profit growth and financial value creation. It identifies the useful market research metrics by looking at their ability to create financial value. It provides the means to integrate market research metrics with metrics from different sources — from social media to market share movement. It is forward looking, not lagging — brand valuation is an exercise built on financial forecasts, predictive metrics, and risk analysis.</p></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Text Block--><span style=""><p>And above all, it is diagnostic. A brand valuation conducted annually will not only track the brand’s success in building value but can also be used to identify and prioritize the actions to be taken to boost brand and business growth over the long haul, and allocate budgets accordingly. Companies that have made the best use of brand valuation have incorporated it into their annual budgeting processes, using the brand valuation metrics to feed into a marketing budget allocation model. At this point, brand valuation starts to fulfill a central role in brand and marketing management.</p></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Photo Block (column)--><div class="align-column"><!--This containing div will give us better contol of an accompanying caption once we add them--><img src="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/a0f8zXxGRi6SPgwTbmLW?signature=b27ff19f30657670f4edca9056ed3841ed4d69374c3034ba8f4b57f9a363d47c&policy=eyJjYWxsIjogWyJyZWFkIiwgImNvbnZlcnQiXSwgImV4cGlyeSI6ICIyNTI0NjU4NDAwIn0=" class="" /><p class="caption"></p></div><!--End Photo Block--><!--Photo Block (left)--><!--Photo Block (right)--><!--Photo Block (left breaking)--><!--Photo Block (full width) NOTE: all blocks with full-width alignment specified need to break the .twelve and .container divs temporarily as shown below--><!--Photo Block (right breaking)--><!--End Photo Block--></div></div></article><!-- <nav class="pagination container"><div class="twelve columns offset-by-two"><a href="" class="pagination__button -prev glyphicons chevron-left"></a><a href="" class="pagination__item">1</a><a href="" class="pagination__item -current">2</a><a href="" class="pagination__item">3</a><a href="" class="pagination__item">4</a><a href="" class="pagination__button -next glyphicons chevron-right"></a></div></nav>   -->
