              <p>We are pleased to report that we have nearly completed all regulatory approvals and certifications required to begin delivery of Model S to our customers in the United States. Thus, we anticipate that initial deliveries will begin in June, ahead of our announced schedule of July.&nbsp;</p><p>On the Powertrain side of our business, we completed the Toyota RAV4 EV development program in Q1 and started deliveries of production components, also ahead of schedule. The RAV4 EV marries the efficiency of an EV&nbsp;with the versatility of an SUV.</p>

              <br><p>In&nbsp;fact it is the only electric SUV on the market. With the largest battery pack of any non-premium EV, it is expected to have a city range of almost 170 miles, more than 60% above the Nissan Leaf. The electric RAV4 is a high performance version of the RAV4 with outstanding acceleration and excellent handling due to the low center of gravity afforded by the floor mounted battery pack.</p>

This program is expected to exceed in value the sum of all powertrain agreements signed in TeslaProducing at this expected volume will allow for economies of scale that give the resulting vehicle a cost of ownership that is on We are excited to begin deliveries of Model S.</p>

              <p>All aspects of the Model S program remain on track to commence deliveries in June. The Tesla Factory is producing vehicles at a steadily increasing rate, and so far this year we have built about 50 Beta and about 30 Release Candidate prototypes. All these vehicles are dedicated to a comprehensive testing program, including crash and safety testing, systems integration, reliability testing, and quality audits.</p>

            <img src="images/img_breaking_left.jpg"/>
            <p><span style="word-spacing: normal;">Model S has now been fully certified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the State of California. We have also successfully completed almost all of the crash testing required under the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act using our Release Candidate prototypes. Once we complete and document the tests, we will be able to sell our vehicles in the United States. This leaves us confident we can begin Model S customer deliveries in June, ahead of our announced schedule of July.</span></p>

              <p>We expect the safety rating of Model S will be independently determined by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and other groups. Under NHTSA’s New Car Assessment Program (NCAP), selected cars are independently purchased and crash tested. NHTSA then assigns “star ratings” to tested cars using the NCAP standards. Based on our internal crash tests and consistent with these published standards, we believe Model S will achieve NHTSA’s top, 5-star, rating. Compliance testing for global markets <a name="marketing"></a>continues and will be announced as achieved.&nbsp;</p>

              <p>Model S Marketing to AccelerateWe had over 9,800 Model S reservations at quarter end, and shortly thereafter topped 10,000. Our growth in reservations during the quarter is particularly significant given that we did not add any new stores during that period. In addition, we also took about 1,000 Model X reservations during the quarter, after its successful introduction in February. We don’t plan to make quarterly Model X reservation updates until next year, when Model X becomes a greater focus of our marketing activities.</p>

            <p><span style="word-spacing: normal;">During the quarter, we completed an agreement with Athlon Car Lease to introduce Model S to corporate customers across Europe. This comes on top of our existing Roadster lease agreement with Athlon. As part of this agreement, Athlon Car Lease reserved 150 Model S sedans to ensure early availability of the car for its customers. This is the first Model S fleet reservation made worldwide by a leasing company. Our lease program with Athlon covers several major countries on the European continent, including Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Belgium and the Netherlands.</span><br></p>

              <p>Our stores continue to see very strong visitor traffic. In the first quarter we had over 410,000 visitors at our six New Design stores and galleries in North America. The pace of marketing the Model S is beginning to accelerate. In April, we opened a store in Oslo, Norway, and plan to open ten additional stores this year at strategic locations domestically, several of which will be in the northeast corridor of the United States. Our reservation holders and the general public will be able to test drive Model S in North America for the first time this summer. These store openings and test drive events should build consumer interest, brand awareness and store visitor traffic as more people experience Model S firsthand.<br></p>

We expect Q2 revenue will be comparable to the Q1 level, and consistent with our prior guidance that 1H revenue will be about 10% of our full year revenue guidance.</p><p>Tides’ financial numbers tell a story of success in 2006: grants to a wide array.
